**Major Detrimental Properties**

`dice: [](artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties-xdmg.md#^major-detrimental-properties)`

| dice: 1d100 | Property |
|-------------|----------|
| 01–09 | You can't attune to other magic items while you're attuned to the Artifact. When you become attuned to the Artifact, your Attunement to other magic items ends immediately. |
| 10–18 | When you become attuned to the Artifact, a random one of your ability scores is reduced by 2, to a minimum of 3. A [Greater Restoration](greater-restoration-xphb.md) spell restores the ability. |
| 19–27 | When you become attuned to the Artifact, you take `8d10` Psychic damage. |
| 28–36 | The first time you become attuned to the Artifact, it gives you a quest determined by the DM. You can't use any of the Artifact's properties until you complete the quest. |
| 37–45 | Each time you become attuned to the Artifact, there is a 10 percent chance that you attract the attention of a god who sends an avatar to wrest the Artifact from you. The avatar has the same alignment as its creator and uses the [Empyrean](empyrean-xmm.md) stat block. Once it obtains the Artifact, the avatar vanishes. |
| 46–54 | Each time you become attuned to the Artifact, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or die from the shock. If you die, you're instantly transformed into a [Wight](wight-xmm.md) under the DM's control that must protect the Artifact. |
| 55–63 | The Artifact dilutes potions within 10 feet of itself, rendering them nonmagical. |
| 64–72 | The Artifact erases scrolls within 10 feet of itself, rendering them nonmagical. |
| 73–81 | While you're attuned to the Artifact, creatures of a particular type other than Humanoid (chosen by the DM) are always [Hostile [Attitude]](hostile-attitude-xphb.md) toward you. |
| 82–90 | While attuned to the Artifact, you have Vulnerability to all damage. |
| 91–96 | The Artifact imprisons a [Death Slaad](death-slaad-xmm.md). Each time you become attuned to the Artifact, the slaad has a 10 percent chance of escaping, whereupon it appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible and attacks you. |
| 97–00 | While attuned to the Artifact, you can't spend Hit Point Dice or regain Hit Points. |
