**Eiselcross Encounters: Levels 17–20**

`dice: [](eiselcross-encounters-levels-1720-egw.md#^eiselcross-encounters-levels-1720)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters find the buried top of an Aeorian tower that crashed into the ice. Ice fills the lower levels of the tower, and `1d4 + 1` [Aeorian nullifiers](aeorian-nullifier-egw.md) (see "chapter 7") are frozen in the ice. |
| 2 | The characters encounter `2d6` gladiator wormkin (see ""Tomb of the Worm"" later in this chapter) attempting to force-feed a group of `3d6` wildfolk [commoners](commoner.md) the meat of the Undermaw. |
| 3 | The characters find a humanoid skull frozen in the ice. If they free the skull, it comes alive, revealing its true form as a [demilich](demilich.md). |
| 4 | The characters encounter two [mages](mage-xmm.md) from Balenpost planning to steal an Aeorian item from a camp of `3d6` [frost giants](frost-giant.md) and their tamed [frost worm](frost-worm-egw.md) (see "chapter 7") The mages ask for the characters' help with the heist. |
| 5 | The characters encounter the [ghost](ghost.md) of an Aeorian citizen. If the characters are kind to the ghost, the undead might be able to share the history of the crashed city with the characters. |
| 6 | The characters encounter `2d6` [frost giant zombies](frost-giant-zombie-egw.md) (see "chapter 7"). These zombies did not come from the Fortress of the Dead Jarl. Their origin is up to you. |
| 7 | The characters cross over an area of thin ice. A [kraken](kraken.md) obsessed with Aeor floats beneath the ice and orders the characters to share any knowledge they have of the place or face its wrath. |
| 8 | An [ancient white dragon](ancient-white-dragon.md) ambushes the characters. |
