| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Moved by pity, a giant eagle continues bringing food to an abandoned [topaz dragon wyrmling](topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md), despite the wyrmling's attempts to eat the eagle. |
| 2 | A [pseudodragon](pseudodragon-xphb.md) who is fanatical about the kinship of all dragonkind is trying to win a [topaz dragon wyrmling's](topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) friendship. |
| 3 | A [topaz dragon wyrmling](topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) has developed a taste for crab meat and persistently hunts a [giant crab](giant-crab-xphb.md) that always manages to evade the wyrmling. (The crab might have been the recipient of a druid's awaken spell.) |
| 4 | A mated pair of [griffons](griffon.md) found a topaz dragon egg, and they care for it as if it were their own. |
| 5 | A [sea hag](sea-hag.md) is on the hunt for a [topaz dragon wyrmling](topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md), to be used as a component in a fell ritual. |
| 6 | A pirate crew keeps a curmudgeonly [topaz dragon wyrmling](topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) as a beloved mascot. |
