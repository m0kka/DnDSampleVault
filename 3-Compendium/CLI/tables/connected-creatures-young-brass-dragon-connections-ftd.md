| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A young brass dragon and a [young blue dragon](young-blue-dragon.md) fight over territory. |
| 2 | A young brass dragon frequently visits a [couatl](couatl.md) who is charged with guarding an ancient temple, sharing stories to help the couatl pass the years. |
| 3 | A [lamia](lamia.md) and a young brass dragon lair in the same desert ruin, mostly leaving each other aloneâ€”but the lamia hopes to corrupt the dragon. |
| 4 | A young brass dragon's lair occasionally spawns [air elementals](air-elemental.md) that roam around the area for a while, causing havoc before eventually dissipating. |
| 5 | A young brass dragon and a [weretiger](weretiger.md) have become close friends as they try to keep a region safe from a growing horde of malicious gnolls. |
| 6 | A young brass dragon allowed a group of [cyclopes](cyclops.md) to shelter in the dragon's lair when they were harassed by a blue dragon. Now the cyclopes won't leave, so the dragon is trying to educate them. |
