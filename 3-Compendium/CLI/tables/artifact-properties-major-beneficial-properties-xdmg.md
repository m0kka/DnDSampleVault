| 31–40       | When you hit with an attack roll while attuned to the Artifact, the target takes an extra `1d6` Force damage.                                                                                                        |

| 51–60       | While attuned to the Artifact, you can cast one level 4 spell (chosen by the DM) from it. After you cast the spell, roll `1d6`. On a roll of 1–5, you can't cast it again in this way until the next dawn.           |
