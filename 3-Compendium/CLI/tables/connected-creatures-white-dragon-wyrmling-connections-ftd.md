|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A pair of [ice mephits](ice-mephit.md) delight in chasing townsfolk into a [white dragon wyrmling's](white-dragon-wyrmling.md) lair to be eaten. |
| 2 | A brooding [griffon](griffon.md) found a dragon egg and cared for it along with her own brood. Though the [white dragon wyrmling](white-dragon-wyrmling.md) ate the griffon's other hatchlings, the griffon treats the wyrmling as her offspring and protects the creature fiercely. |

| 5 | A well-meaning [druid](druid.md) is trying to rear a [white dragon wyrmling](white-dragon-wyrmling.md) as a guardian of nature, training the dragon to hunt only Monstrosities. But the wyrmling keeps attacking other creatures. |
| 6 | A band of [ogres](ogre-xmm.md) keeps a [white dragon wyrmling](white-dragon-wyrmling.md) caged near their larder, as they have discovered that the dragon's cold breath keeps their meat fresh. |
