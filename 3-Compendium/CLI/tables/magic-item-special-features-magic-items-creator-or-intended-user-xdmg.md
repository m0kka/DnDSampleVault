| dice: 1d20 | Creator or Intended User |
|------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Aberration. The item is ancient. At a glance, it seems to be covered with mucus. |
| 2 | Celestial. The item is half the normal weight and inscribed with feathered wings, suns, and stars. Fiends find it repulsive. |
| 3 | Devotees of Lolth. The item is half the normal weight. It is inscribed with spiders and webs in honor of Lolth. |
| 4 | Dragon. This item incorporates precious metals and gems from a dragon's hoard. It grows warm when within 120 feet of a Dragon. |
| 5–6 | Dwarf. The item is durable and has Dwarvish runes worked into its design. It might be associated with a clan that would like to see it returned to their ancestral halls. |
| 7 | Elemental Air. The item is half the normal weight and feels hollow. If it's made of fabric, it is diaphanous. |
| 8 | Elemental Earth. This item might be crafted from stone. Any cloth or leather elements are studded with finely polished rock. |
| 9 | Elemental Fire. This item is warm to the touch, and any metal parts are crafted from black iron. Flame imagery covers its surface. |
| 10 | Elemental Water. Lustrous fish scales replace leather or cloth on this item, and seashells and worked coral (as hard as any metal) replace metal portions. |
| 11–12 | Elf. The item is half the normal weight. It is adorned with symbols of nature: leaves, vines, stars, and the like. |
| 13 | Fey. The item is exquisitely crafted from the finest materials and glows with a pale radiance in moonlight, shedding [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) in a 5-foot radius. Any metal in the item is silver or mithral rather than iron or steel. |
| 14 | Fiend. The item is made of iron or horn, and any cloth or leather components are crafted from the hide of Fiends. Leering faces or vile runes are engraved on its surface. Celestials find it repulsive. |
| 15 | Giant. The item is larger than normal and was crafted by Giants for use by their smaller allies. |
| 16 | Gnome. The item is crafted to appear ordinary and well used. It could also incorporate gears and mechanical components, even if these aren't essential to its function. |
| 17–19 | Human. The item was created during the heyday of a fallen human kingdom, or it is tied to a human of legend. It might hold writing in a forgotten language or symbols whose significance is lost to the ages. |
| 20 | Undead. The item incorporates symbols of death, such as bones and skulls, and it might be crafted from parts of corpses. It feels cold to the touch. |
