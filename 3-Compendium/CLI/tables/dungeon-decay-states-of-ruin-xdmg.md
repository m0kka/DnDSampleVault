*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 67* 

**States of Ruin**

`dice: [](dungeon-decay-states-of-ruin-xdmg.md#^states-of-ruin)`

| dice: 1d6 | Features |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Perilous. The area is dangerously worn and prone to collapse. Any impacts or damage to the structure, including from spells and other areas of effect, have a 50 percent chance of causing a collapse. |
| 2 | Crumbling. Areas within the dungeon section are choked with rubble and have a 50 percent chance of being [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md). [Half Cover](3-Compendium/CLI/tables/cover-xphb.md) and hiding places are plentiful. |
| 3 | Neglected. One dungeon hazard—such as "brown mold", "green slime", or "yellow mold" (see ""Hazards"" in this chapter)—is abundant. |
| 4 | Abandoned. Most of the dungeon is deserted. Dexterity ([Stealth](skills.md#Stealth)) checks have [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) because any sounds stand out as unusual. |
| 5 | Secure. Ability checks made to break down doors, open locks, or carry out similar activities have Disadvantage. |
| 6 | Thriving. The dungeon is heavily populated. Any loud noises draw the attention of nearby creatures. |
