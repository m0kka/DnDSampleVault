**Ancient Black Dragon Connections**

`dice: [](connected-creatures-ancient-black-dragon-connections-ftd.md#^ancient-black-dragon-connections)`

| dice: d4 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | An ancient black dragon, after studying blasphemous texts dedicated to alien gods, issues a warning that a corrupted planetar will soon fall to earth like a meteor in the fens outside a great city's walls. |
| 2 | An illithid community has spent nearly a millennium raising and preparing a black dragon to become an [elder brain dragon](elder-brain-dragon-ftd.md) (described in "chapter 6"), so the [elder brain](elder-brain-mpmm.md) can wreak ruin upon its rivals. |
| 3 | The decades-long machinations of an ancient black dragon and an evil [archmage](archmage.md) are nearing fruition. If their pact succeeds, they will unleash devastation on a continental scale. |
| 4 | An ancient black dragon rules a vast, decadent city built on artificial islands within a polluted lake. The site is threatened with destruction by an enraged [archdruid](archdruid-mpmm.md)â€”but destroying the city means thousands of innocents will die. |
