| 2 | An [abominable yeti](abominable-yeti.md) and `1d4` [yetis](yeti.md) stalk the characters. |
| 3 | The characters encounter `2d4` [yetis from Allowak's Sanctuary](allowak-yeti-egw.md) (see ""Allowak's Sanctuary Yeti Statistics"" later in this chapter). The yetis attempt to scare the characters away but do not wish to do harm. |
