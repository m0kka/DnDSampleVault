**Layers of the Beastlands**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Krigala | The River Oceanus is a strong torrent flowing through this wilderness of eternal summer noon. |
| Brux | A red sun hovers forever on the horizon as mists and streams roil through the trees in eternal twilight. |
| Karasuthra | A pale moon provides the only light in this wilderness of eternal night. |
