**Layers of the Abyss**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| The Plain of Infinite Portals | On layer 1, corroded iron fortresses defend routes to lower layers. |
| Azzagrat | Graz'zt's corrupt, decadent city is split across layers 45, 46, and 47. |
| The Demonweb | On layer 66, Lolth's web snares all and hides portals to other planes. |
| Gaping Maw | Layer 88 is a malevolent wilderness surrounding Demogorgon's ocean fortress. |
| Thanatos | On layer 113, an endless graveyard hosts Orcus and the sleepless dead. |
| The Slime Pits (Shedaklah) | Layer 222, a fetid realm of ooze and fungi, obeys the whims of Juiblex and Zuggtmoy. |
| The Death Dells | Yeenoghu and his gnoll servants prowl layer 422â€”a cruel, desolate realm. |
| The Endless Maze | Layer 600's endless labyrinth turns visitors into Baphomet's prey. |
