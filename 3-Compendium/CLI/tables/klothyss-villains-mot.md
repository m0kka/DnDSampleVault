**Klothys's Villains**

`dice: [](klothyss-villains-mot.md#^klothyss-villains)`

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A single-minded Nyxborn [assassin](assassin.md) of Klothys hunts a hero who was raised from the dead. |
| 2 | Believing in the holiness of a terrible beast, Klothys's [acolytes](acolyte.md) murder heroes sent to deal with it. |
| 3 | Certain that civilization offends fate, a [priest](priest.md) raises a herd of [typhons](typhon-mot.md) to release on a city. |
| 4 | Insulted [satyr revelers](satyr-reveler-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") channel Klothys's magic to drive a polis's priests into embarrassing debauchery. |
| 5 | An [oracle](oracle-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") knows it is a character's destiny to serve Klothys. The seer manufactures tragedy for the individual to provoke this revelation. |
| 6 | A [cult fanatic](cult-fanatic.md) of Klothys believes that the characters' deeds mark them as servants of the titans, destined to free one of those ancient terrors. |
