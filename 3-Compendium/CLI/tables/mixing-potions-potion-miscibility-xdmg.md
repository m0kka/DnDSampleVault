**Potion Miscibility**

`dice: [](mixing-potions-potion-miscibility-xdmg.md#^potion-miscibility)`

| dice: 1d100 | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 01 | Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture creates a magical explosion in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere [Area of Effect]](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on itself. Each creature in that area takes `4d10` Force damage. |
| 02–08 | Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture becomes an ingested poison of your choice (see ""Poison"" in "chapter 3"). |
| 09–15 | Both potions lose their effects. |
| 16–25 | One potion loses its effect. |
| 26–35 | Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. If a potion has no numerical effect and no duration, it instead loses its effect. |
| 36–90 | Both potions work normally. |
| 91–99 | Both potions work, but the numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally. |
| 00 | Only one potion works, but its effects are permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a [Potion of Healing](potion-of-healing-xdmg.md) might increase the drinker's Hit Point maximum by `2d4 + 2`, or a [Potion of Invisibility](potion-of-invisibility-xdmg.md) might give the drinker the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition indefinitely. At your discretion, a [Dispel Magic](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md) spell or similar magic might end this lasting effect. |
