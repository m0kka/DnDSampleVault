**Nylea's Villains**

`dice: [](nyleas-villains-mot.md#^nyleas-villains)`

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A Setessan hunt-leader ([Setessan hoplite](setessan-hoplite-mot.md); see "chapter 6") swears vengeance on a poacher in the Nessian Wood who turns out to be an Akroan general. |
| 2 | A [hydra](hydra.md) goes on a rampage at the edge of the forest. It must be dealt with, but a [druid](druid.md) follower of Nylea will take vengeance on anyone who kills it outright. |
| 3 | A [mage](mage-xmm.md) who lives in a secluded grove has been using a magic item to transform interlopers into boars. She claims that Nylea gave her this item. |
| 4 | A [druid](druid.md) uses magic on fields near the border of the forest, creating animated plants to drive off farmers. |
| 5 | A [scout](scout.md) has taken to hunting and eating sapient beings. What could have caused this gruesome turn? |
| 6 | Those who follow a mysterious green [unicorn](unicorn.md) inevitably turn up dead, their bodies entangled in strangling vines. |
