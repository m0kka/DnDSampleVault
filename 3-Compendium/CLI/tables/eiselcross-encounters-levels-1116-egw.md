`dice: [](eiselcross-encounters-levels-1116-egw.md#^eiselcross-encounters-levels-1116)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | An [adult white dragon](adult-white-dragon.md) confronts the characters, demanding treasure for passage through its territory. The dragon accepts 1,000 gp worth of treasure or a rare magic item as acceptable tribute. |
| 2 | The characters encounter an [iron golem](iron-golem.md) that keeps walking in circles. The golem attacks any creatures within 10 feet of it but otherwise continues walking in circles. |
| 3 | The characters find a camp of `2d4` [minotaurs](minotaur.md) and `4d6` [orcs](orc.md) looking for wildfolk to recruit for the Kryn. These explorers want to keep their operation covert. If they aren't convinced the characters can keep their secret, the Xhorhasians attack. |
| 4 | A [roc](roc.md) flies overhead and attempts to scoop up a character of your choice as its next meal. |
| 5 | The characters encounter a coven of three [night hags](night-hag.md) searching for Aeorian items. In their humanoid guises, these hags pretend to be lost explorers and request the characters' escort. When the characters are in a vulnerable spot, the hags reveal their true nature and attack. |
| 6 | The characters are ambushed by `1d8 + 1` [frost giants](frost-giant.md). |
