| dice: d20 | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Your parents were murdered in front of you. Roll on the "Ally and Rival Identities table" to determine the type of creature that killed them. You have proficiency in the Stealth and Survival skills. |
| 2 | You met a dark elf dying in the wilderness. Around their neck was a silver talisman containing a cameo of their child and the name "Il'viranya." It is an amulet of proof against detection and location. |
| 3 | A mysterious stranger gave you a gift that saved your life while you were lost in the wilderness. Roll on the "Ally and Rival Identities table" to determine the identity of the stranger. Then roll on Magic Item Table B in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to determine the item. If you roll a consumable item from the table, roll again. |
| 4 | You were caught in a terrible storm but miraculously survived. Now your dreams contain visions sent by a mysterious god or demigod. You have proficiency in the Arcana or Religion skill (your choice). |
| 5 | A famous warrior trained you with what has become your signature weapon. You have proficiency with a martial weapon of your choice, and you own one such weapon. It has special features as detailed in "chapter 7" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide". You also have the Martial Adept feat from the "Player's Handbook". |
| 6 | You were the sole survivor when a horde of rampaging monsters raided your village or your neighborhood. You have proficiency in the Stealth skill or proficiency with martial weapons (your choice). |
| 7 | A famous mage saw potential in you and tutored you in the arcane arts. You have a spellbook and the Magic Initiate feat from the "Player's Handbook". |
| 8 | While on a long journey, you were picked up by a traveling circus, spending a year with them before returning to your home. You have proficiency in the Acrobatics or Performance skill (your choice) and proficiency with the disguise kit. |
| 9 | You were transformed into a bear by mysterious magic, and lived for a year as an animal before you were saved by a druid. Magic still lingers within you, though, and you can cast speak with animals at will. |
| 10 | You were press-ganged into military service, and were left shaken by what you saw on the battlefield. You have proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. You also have a random form of indefinite madness, determined by rolling on the Indefinite Madness table in chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide". |
| 11 | You were kidnapped by bandits while traveling between towns. While captured, you met an old thief who helped you escape. You have proficiency with thieves' tools and proficiency in the Stealth skill. |
| 12 | You were visited by a demon lord in a dream. You awakened knowing the find familiar spell and are now able to cast it as a ritual, but your familiar always takes the form of a [quasit](quasit-xphb.md). You also have a random form of indefinite madness, determined by rolling on the Indefinite Madness table in chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide". |
| 13 | While exploring a remote forest, you were attacked by evil lycanthropes but escaped before being killed. You are cursed with [wereboar](wereboar.md), [wererat](wererat.md), or [werewolf](werewolf.md) lycanthropy (DM's choice). |
| 14 | While lost in a remote forest or jungle, you were saved by a [werebear](werebear.md) or [weretiger](weretiger.md) (DM's choice). The lycanthrope believed you were destined for greatness and granted you the gift of lycanthropy with your consent. |
| 15 | You saved a pseudodragon from being eaten by a giant spider in a dark forest. The [pseudodragon](pseudodragon-xphb.md) now loyally follows you wherever you go, even if you'd rather it stay hidden. It is controlled by the DM but obeys your commands if treated well. |
| 16 | You nearly died from a virulent disease (the DM's choice of cackle fever, sewer plague, or sight rot; see "chapter 8" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). Your life was saved by an agent of the Cobalt Soul, who could not cure the disease, but who gave you a periapt of health that suppresses it. |
| 17 | You were accused of a crime and were exiled or imprisoned, regardless of whether or not you were guilty. Having spent time among criminals, you have proficiency in the Intimidation skill and you know thieves' cant. |
| 18 | You saved a riderless horse wearing full tack and harness from wolves. You own a [riding horse](3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/beast/riding-horse-xphb.md) and a saddle, and you have proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. |
| 19 | While reading through a mysterious tome once owned by your parent, you found a treasure map that points toward a place in Wildemount of the DM's choice. |
| 20 | You received a letter revealing that you were the secret child of a wealthy noble family living in Rexxentrum within the Dwendalian Empire. They enclosed 100 gp to ensure your safe passage to the imperial capital, and a signet ring bearing your true family's seal. |
