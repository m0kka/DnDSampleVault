# Menagerie
*Level 13 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 2
- **Order**: recruit

A Menagerie has enclosures big enough to contain up to four Large creatures. Four Small or Medium creatures can occupy the same space as one Large creature there.

## Recruit: Creature

When you issue the "Recruit" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hirelings to add a creature from the Menagerie Creatures table to your Menagerie. The recruitment takes 7 days and costs you the amount listed in the table. The hirelings look after the creature.

Creatures in your Menagerie count as Bastion Defenders. Deduct any you lose from your Bastion Defenders roster. You can choose not to count one or more of these creatures as Bastion Defenders, in which case they can't be called on to defend the Bastion. Instead, they act in accordance with their nature and use their stat blocks in the "Monster Manual".

Typically only Beasts and some Monstrosities can be kept in a Menagerie, though the DM might allow other creatures.
