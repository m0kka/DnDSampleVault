# Laboratory
*Level 9 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: craft

A Laboratory contains storage space for alchemical supplies and workspaces for crafting various concoctions.

## Craft Options

When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Craft.** Alchemist's Supplies. The facility's hireling crafts anything that can be made with [Alchemist's Supplies](alchemists-supplies-xphb.md) using the rules in the "Player's Handbook" and "chapter 7" of this book.  
- **Craft.** Poison. You commission the facility's hireling to craft a vial containing one application of a poison. The poison must be one of the following: [Burnt Othur Fumes](burnt-othur-fumes-xdmg.md), [Essence of Ether](essence-of-ether-xdmg.md), or [Torpor](torpor-xdmg.md). This work takes 7 days, and you must pay half the poison's cost. See ""Poison"" in "chapter 3" for descriptions and costs of poisons.
