# Archive
*Level 13 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq) or Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: research

An Archive is a repository of valuable books, maps, and scrolls. It is usually attached to a Library behind a locked or secret door.

## Research: Helpful Lore

When you issue the "Research" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to search the Archive for helpful lore. The work takes 7 days. The hireling gains knowledge as if they had cast the [Legend Lore](legend-lore-xphb.md) spell, then shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them.

## Reference Book

Your Archive contains one copy of a rare and valuable reference book, which gives you a benefit while you and the book are in your Bastion. You can choose one of the following options (your DM might make more options available):

- **Bigby's Handy Arcana Codex.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([Arcana](skills.md#Arcana)) check you make when you take the [Study](actions.md#Study) action to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, and planes of existence.  
- **The Chronepsis Chronicles.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([History](skills.md#History)) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, wars, and lost civilizations.  
- **Investigations of the Inquisitive.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([Investigation](skills.md#Investigation)) check you make when you take the Study action to make deductions based on clues or evidence or to recall lore about traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry.  
- **Material Musings on the Nature of the World.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([Nature](skills.md#Nature)) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and the weather.  
- **The Old Faith and Other Religions.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([Religion](skills.md#Religion)) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.  

## Enlarging the Facility

You can enlarge your Archive to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, you gain two additional reference books chosen from the list above.
