# Greenhouse
*Level 9 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: harvest

A Greenhouse is an enclosure where rare plants and fungi are nurtured in a controlled climate.

## Fruit of Restoration

One plant in your Greenhouse has three magical fruits growing on it. Any creature that eats one of these fruits gains the benefit of a [Lesser Restoration](lesser-restoration-xphb.md) spell. Fruits that aren't eaten within 24 hours of being picked lose their magic. The plant replaces all picked fruits daily at dawn, and it can't be transplanted without killing it.

## Harvest Options

When you issue the "Harvest" order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Harvest.** Healing Herbs. You commission the facility's hireling to create a [Potion of Healing (greater)](potion-of-greater-healing-xdmg.md) made from healing herbs. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.  
- **Harvest.** Poison. You commission the facility's hireling to extract one application of a poison from rare plants or fungi. Choose the type of poison from the following options: [Assassin's Blood](assassins-blood-xdmg.md), [Malice](malice-xdmg.md), [Pale Tincture](pale-tincture-xdmg.md), or [Truth Serum](truth-serum-xdmg.md). See ""Poison"" in "chapter 3" for each poison's effect. Once harvested, the poison can be contained in a vial. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.
