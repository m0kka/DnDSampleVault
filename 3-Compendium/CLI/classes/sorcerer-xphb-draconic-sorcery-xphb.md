# Draconic Sorcery
*[Sorcerer](sorcerer-xphb.md): Sorcerer Subclass*  
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 148*  


## Class Features

### Draconic Sorcery (Level 3)

*Breathe the Magic of Dragons*

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons' power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon's hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

### Draconic Resilience (Level 3)

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren't wearing armor, your base [Armor Class](armor-class-xphb.md) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

### Draconic Spells (Level 3)

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Draconic Spells**

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|----------------|--------|
| 3rd | [Alter Self](alter-self-xphb.md), [Chromatic Orb](chromatic-orb-xphb.md), [Command](command-xphb.md), [Dragon's Breath](dragons-breath-xphb.md) |
| 5th | [Fear](fear-xphb.md), [Fly](fly-xphb.md) |
| 7th | [Arcane Eye](arcane-eye-xphb.md), [Charm Monster](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/charm-monster-xphb.md) |

### Elemental Affinity (Level 6)

Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You have [Resistance](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

### Dragon Wings (Level 14)

As a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). For the duration, you have a [Fly Speed](fly-speed-xphb.md) of 60 feet.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md) unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Dragon Companion (Level 18)

You can cast [Summon Dragon](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/summon-dragon-xphb.md) without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require [Concentration](conditions.md#Concentration). If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.
