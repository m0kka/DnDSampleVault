# Hunter
*[Ranger](ranger-xphb.md): Ranger Subclass*  
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 127*  


## Class Features

### Hunter (Level 3)

*Protect Nature and People from Destruction*

You stalk prey in the wilds and elsewhere, using your abilities as a Hunter to protect nature and people everywhere from forces that would destroy them.

### Hunter's Prey (Level 3)

You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [Short Rest](short-rest-xphb.md) or [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md), you can replace the chosen option with the other one.

#### Colossus Slayer

Your tenacity can wear down even the most resilient foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon, the weapon deals an extra `1d8` damage to the target if it's missing any of its [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

#### Horde Breaker

Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with a weapon, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target, that is within the weapon's range, and that you haven't attacked this turn.

### Hunter's Lore (Level 3)

You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your Hunter's Mark, you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.

### Defensive Tactics (Level 7)

You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [Short Rest](short-rest-xphb.md) or [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md), you can replace the chosen option with the other one.

#### Escape the Horde

[Opportunity Attacks](actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack) have [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) against you.

#### Multiattack Defense

When a creature hits you with an attack roll, that creature has [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on all other attack rolls against you this turn.

### Superior Hunter's Prey (Level 11)

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature marked by your Hunter's Mark, you can also deal that spell's extra damage to a different creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature.

### Superior Hunter's Defense (Level 15)

When you take damage, you can take a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) to give yourself [Resistance](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to that damage and any other damage of the same type until the end of the current turn.
