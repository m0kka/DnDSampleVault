# Gloom Stalker
*[Ranger](ranger-xphb.md): Ranger Subclass*  
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 125*  


## Class Features

### Gloom Stalker (Level 3)

*Draw on Shadow Magic to Fight Your Foes*

Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places, wielding magic drawn from the Shadowfell to combat enemies that lurk in darkness.

### Dread Ambusher (Level 3)

You have mastered the art of creating fearsome ambushes, granting you the following benefits.

#### Ambusher's Leap

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your [Speed](speed-xphb.md) increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

#### Dreadful Strike

When you attack a creature and hit it with a weapon, you can deal an extra `2d6` Psychic damage. You can use this benefit only once per turn, you can use it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).

#### Initiative Bonus

When you roll [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md), you can add your Wisdom modifier to the roll.

### Gloom Stalker Spells (Level 3)

When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Gloom Stalker Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Umbral Sight (Level 3)

You gain [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision) with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision) when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision). While entirely in [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you have the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition to any creature that relies on [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision) to see you in that [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).

### Iron Mind (Level 7)

You have honed your ability to resist mind-altering powers. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Stalker's Flurry (Level 11)

The Psychic damage of your Dreadful Strike becomes `2d8`. In addition, when you use the Dreadful Strike effect of your Dread Ambusher feature, you can cause one of the following additional effects.

#### Sudden Strike

You can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and that is within the weapon's range.

#### Mass Fear

The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature has the [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition until the start of your next turn.

### Shadowy Dodge (Level 15)

When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can take a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) to impose [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on that roll. Whether the attack hits or misses, you can then teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
