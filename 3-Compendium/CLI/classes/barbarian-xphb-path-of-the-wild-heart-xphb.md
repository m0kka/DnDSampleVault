## Class Features

### Path of the Wild Heart (Level 3)

*Walk in Community with the Animal World*

Barbarians who follow the Path of the Wild Heart view themselves as kin to animals. These Barbarians learn magical means to communicate with animals, and their Rage heightens their connection to animals as it fills them with supernatural might.

### Animal Speaker (Level 3)

You can cast the [Beast Sense](beast-sense-xphb.md) and [Speak with Animals](speak-with-animals-xphb.md) spells but only as Rituals. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.

### Rage of the Wilds (Level 3)

Your Rage taps into the primal power of animals. Whenever you activate your Rage, you gain one of the following options of your choice.

#### Bear

While your Rage is active, you have [Resistance](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to every damage type except Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant.
