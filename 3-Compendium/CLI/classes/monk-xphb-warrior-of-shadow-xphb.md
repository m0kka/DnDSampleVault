# Warrior of Shadow
*[Monk](monk-xphb.md): Monk Subclass*  
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 105*  


## Class Features

### Warrior of Shadow (Level 3)

*Harness Shadow Power for Stealth and Subterfuge*

Warriors of Shadow practice stealth and subterfuge, harnessing the power of the Shadowfell. They are at home in darkness, able to draw gloom around themselves to hide, leap from shadow to shadow, and take on a wraithlike form.

### Shadow Arts (Level 3)

You have learned to draw on the power of the Shadowfell, gaining the following benefits.

### Darkness (Level 3)

You can expend 1 Focus Point to cast the [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/spells/darkness-xphb.md) spell without spell components. You can see within the spell's area when you cast it with this feature. While the spell persists, you can move its area of [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) to a space within 60 feet of yourself at the start of each of your turns.

### Darkvision (Level 3)

You gain [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision) with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision), its range increases by 60 feet.

### Shadowy Figments (Level 3)

You know the [Minor Illusion](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/minor-illusion-xphb.md) spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

### Shadow Step (Level 6)

While entirely within [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you can use a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md). You then have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on the next melee attack you make before the end of the current turn.

### Improved Shadow Step (Level 11)

You can draw on your Shadowfell connection to empower your teleportation. When you use your Shadow Step, you can expend 1 Focus Point to remove the requirement that you must start and end in [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) for that use of the feature. As part of this [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), you can make an [Unarmed Strike](unarmed-strike-xphb.md) immediately after you teleport.

### Cloak of Shadows (Level 17)

As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action while entirely within [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you can expend 3 Focus Points to shroud yourself with shadows for 1 minute, until you have the [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition, or until you end your turn in [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md). While shrouded by these shadows, you gain the following benefits.

#### Invisibility

You have the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

#### Partially Incorporeal

You can move through occupied spaces as if they were [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md). If you end your turn in such a space, you are shunted to the last unoccupied space you were in.

#### Shadow Flurry

You can use your Flurry of Blows without expending any Focus Points.
