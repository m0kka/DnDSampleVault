# Circle of the Stars
*[Druid](druid-xphb.md): Druid Subclass*  
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 88*  


## Class Features

### Circle of the Stars (Level 3)

*Harness Secrets Hidden in Constellations*

The Circle of the Stars has tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By understanding these secrets, the Druids of this circle seek to harness the powers of the cosmos.

### Star Map (Level 3)

You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a [Spellcasting Focus](spellcasting-focus-xphb.md) for your Druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding the map, you have the [Guidance](guidance-xphb.md) and [Guiding Bolt](guiding-bolt-xphb.md) spells prepared, and you can cast [Guiding Bolt](guiding-bolt-xphb.md) without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a [Short Rest](short-rest-xphb.md) or [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md), and it destroys the previous map.

### Starry Form (Level 3)

As a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.

### Archer (Level 3)

A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to `1d8` plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Chalice (Level 3)

A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) equal to `1d8` plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Dragon (Level 3)

A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain [Concentration](conditions.md#Concentration), you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the `d20` as a 10.

### Cosmic Omen (Level 6)

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md), you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md), you gain access to a special [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

- **Weal (even).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a [D20 Test](d20-test-xphb.md), you can take a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) to roll `1d6` and add the number rolled to the total.  
- **Woe (odd).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a [D20 Test](d20-test-xphb.md), you can take a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) to roll `1d6` and subtract the number rolled from the total.  

You can use this [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).

### Twinkling Constellations (Level 10)

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The `1d8` of the Archer and the Chalice becomes `2d8`, and while the Dragon is active, you have a [Fly Speed](fly-speed-xphb.md) of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

### Full of Stars (Level 14)

While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you [Resistance](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
