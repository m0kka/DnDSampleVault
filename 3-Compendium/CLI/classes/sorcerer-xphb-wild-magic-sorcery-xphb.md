# Wild Magic Sorcery
*[Sorcerer](sorcerer-xphb.md): Sorcerer Subclass*  
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 149*  


## Class Features

### Wild Magic Sorcery (Level 3)

*Unleash Chaotic Magic*

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

### Wild Magic Surge (Level 3)

Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll `` immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.

If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.

### Tides of Chaos (Level 3)

You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on one [D20 Test](d20-test-xphb.md) before you roll the `d20`. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot or finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md) before you can use this feature again.

If you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md), you automatically roll on the [Wild Magic Surge](wild-magic-surge-xphb.md) table.

### Bend Luck (Level 6)

You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Immediately after another creature you can see rolls the `d20` for a [D20 Test](d20-test-xphb.md), you can take a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll `1d4` and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the `d20` roll.

### Controlled Chaos (Level 14)

You gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild [Magic](actions.md#Magic) Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.

### Tamed Surge (Level 18)

Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an effect of your choice from the [Wild Magic Surge](wild-magic-surge-xphb.md) table instead of rolling on that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).
