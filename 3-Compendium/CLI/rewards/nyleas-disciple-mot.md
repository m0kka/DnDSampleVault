# Nylea's Disciple
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 25+ Nylea trait*

When a beast is about to attack you, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses you. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this trait for 24 hours.
