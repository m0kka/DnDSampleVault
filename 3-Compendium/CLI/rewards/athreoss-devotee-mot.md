# Athreos's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Athreos trait*

Your life is intertwined with the fate of the dead. You can cast gentle repose with this trait, requiring no material components, a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
