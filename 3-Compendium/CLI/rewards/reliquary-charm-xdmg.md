# Reliquary Charm
*Charm*  

After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical Charm (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [Greater Restoration](greater-restoration-xphb.md) once without expending a spell slot or using Material components. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.
