# Draconic Familiar
*Draconic Gift, uncommon*  

You gain the aid of a draconic familiar, which might be a splinter of the consciousness of a dragon that invested you with power.

You can cast the find familiar spell as a ritual without using any material components. When you cast the spell in this way, your familiar always takes the form of a [pseudodragon](pseudodragon-xphb.md).

Additionally, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your pseudodragon familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
