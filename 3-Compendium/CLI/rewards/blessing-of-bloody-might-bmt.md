# Blessing of Bloody Might

Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

## Consequence

The character is cursed with werewolf <span title="Monster Manual">Player Characters as Lycanthropes</span> (see the "Monster Manual") until the blessing ends on them. On nights when the moon is full, the cursed character flies into a rage that lasts until dawn; while in this state, the character becomes an NPC under the DM's control.
