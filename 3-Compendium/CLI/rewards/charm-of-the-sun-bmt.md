# Charm of the Sun

You learn the Light cantrip if you don't already know it. You can cast Sunburst, requiring no spell components and using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Once used, the charm vanishes from you, and you unlearn the Light cantrip gained from this charm.
