# Dimir Charm
*Charm*  

When you activate this charm, you can cast the blink or sleep (3rd-level version) spell. Alternatively, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.
