# Charm of the Knight

As an action, you can summon two neutral good [knights](knight-xmm.md) that are Celestials instead of Humanoids. The knights appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and act as your allies. They take their turns immediately after yours on your initiative count. The knights remain for 10 minutes, until they or you die, or until you dismiss one or both of them as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
