# Iroas's Votary
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 10+ Iroas trait*

You can cast crusader's mantle with this trait. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
