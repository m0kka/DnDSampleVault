# Draconic Senses
*Draconic Gift, rare*  

You gain keen senses like a dragon's.

## Blindsight

You have blindsight to a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see invisible creatures within that range, unless the creatures successfully hide from you.

## Keen Senses

You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.
