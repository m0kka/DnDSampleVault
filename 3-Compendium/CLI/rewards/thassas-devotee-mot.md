# Thassa's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Thassa trait*

As a devotee of Thassa, you have proven yourself a worthy representative of the god of the sea. You can cast fog cloud with this trait. Fog created in this way smells strongly of the sea. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
