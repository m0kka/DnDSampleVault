  "name": "Amorphous"
- "desc": "If the oblex takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and\
    \ ability checks until the end of its next turn."
  "name": "Aversion to Fire"
- "desc": "The oblex doesn't require sleep."
  "name": "Unusual Nature"

  "name": "Temporary Statblock"
"actions":
- "desc": "The elder oblex makes two Pseudopod attacks, and it uses Eat Memories."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6\
    \ + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage."
  "name": "Pseudopod"
- "desc": "The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target\
    \ must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 44 (8d10) psychic damage\
    \ and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it\
    \ benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, Oozes, Plants,\
    \ and Undead succeed on the save automatically.\n\nWhile memory drained, the target\
    \ must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack\
    \ roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the\
    \ die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so\
    \ on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious\
    \ for 1 hour. The effect then ends.\n\nThe oblex learns all the languages a memory-drained\
    \ target knows and gains all its skill proficiencies."
  "name": "Eat Memories"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The oblex extrudes a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one\
    \ Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears,\
    \ feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells\
    \ faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 2d6 + 1 different creatures, each\
    \ one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet\
    \ away. The simulacrum is an extension of the oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies\
    \ its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The tether is immune to\
    \ damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between\
    \ the oblex and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed."
