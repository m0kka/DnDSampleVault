- "desc": "The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space,\
    \ but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage\
    \ on the saving throw.\n\nCreatures inside the cube can be seen but have total\
    \ cover.\n\nA creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a\
    \ creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength\
    \ check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.\n\nThe\
    \ cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures\
    \ inside it at a time."
  "name": "Ooze Cube"
- "desc": "Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom\
    \ (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature\
    \ that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised\
    \ by the cube."

  "name": "Pseudopod"
- "desc": "The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller\
    \ creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature\
    \ must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.\n\nOn a successful save, the creature\
    \ can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that\
    \ chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.\n\
    \nOn a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes\
    \ 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is\
    \ restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's\
    \ turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.\n\nAn engulfed\
    \ creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check.\
    \ On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5\
    \ feet of the cube."
