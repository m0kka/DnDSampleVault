"traits":
- "desc": "The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17,\
    \ +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring\
    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: detect evil and good, detect magic,\
    \ thunderwave, disguise self (often with a longer duration than is normal for\
    \ that spell; see Disguises)\n\n1/day each: conjure elemental ([air elemental](/3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md)\
    \ only), creation, gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift\n\n3/day\
    \ each: create food and water (can create wine instead of water), tongues, wind\
    \ walk, true polymorph (mightier genies only; see Disguises)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving\
    \ behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will,\
    \ often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies\
    \ can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with\
    \ a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,\
    \ but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well."
  "name": "Disguises"
"actions":
- "desc": "The djinni makes three scimitar attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6\
    \ + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice)."
  "name": "Scimitar"
- "desc": "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms\
    \ on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as\
    \ long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).\
    \ Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18\
    \ Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind\
    \ up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with\
    \ it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\n\nA creature can use\
    \ its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself,\
    \ by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature\
    \ is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
