  "name": "Scimitar"
- "desc": "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms\
    \ on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as\
    \ long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).\
    \ Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18\
    \ Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind\
    \ up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with\
    \ it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\n\nA creature can use\
    \ its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself,\
    \ by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature\
    \ is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
