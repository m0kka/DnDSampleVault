"traits":
- "desc": "The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6\
    \ to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring\
    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: detect evil and good, detect magic,\
    \ stone shape, disguise self (often with a longer duration than is normal for\
    \ that spell; see Disguises)\n\n1/day each: conjure elemental ([earth elemental](/3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md)\
    \ only), gaseous form, invisibility, phantasmal killer, plane shift, wall of stone\n\
    \n3/day each: passwall, move earth, tongues, true polymorph (mightier genies\
    \ only; see Disguises)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While\
    \ doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through."

- "desc": "If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving\
    \ behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against\
    \ effects that would knock it prone."
  "name": "Sure-Footed"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will,\
    \ often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies\
    \ can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with\
    \ a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,\
    \ but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well."
