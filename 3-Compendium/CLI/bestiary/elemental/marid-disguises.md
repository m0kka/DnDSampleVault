- "desc": "The marid's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16,\
    \ +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring\
    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: create or destroy water, detect evil\
    \ and good, detect magic, fog cloud, purify food and drink, disguise self (often\
    \ with a longer duration than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)\n\n1/day\
    \ each: conjure elemental ([water elemental](/3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md)\
    \ only), control water, gaseous form, invisibility, plane shift\n\n3/day each:\
    \ tongues, water breathing, water walk, true polymorph (mightier genies only;\
    \ see Disguises)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The marid can breathe air and water."
  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam,\
    \ leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will,\
    \ often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies\
    \ can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with\
    \ a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,\
    \ but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well."

  "name": "Trident"
- "desc": "The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide.\
    \ Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure,\
    \ a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is\
    \ pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a success, a\
    \ target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked\
    \ prone."
