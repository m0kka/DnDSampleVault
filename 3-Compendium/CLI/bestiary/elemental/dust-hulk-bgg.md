# [Dust Hulk](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\elemental/dust-hulk-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 131*  

Dust hulks are descended from enclaves of stone giants who lived in extreme environments, isolated from others. Elemental energy from the Plane of Air eroded their physical forms and slowly transformed them into Elementals. They are little more than clouds of gravel and dust, barely maintaining a cohesive form. When a dust hulk dies, it disperses into a cloud of dust.

Dust hulks retain their ancestors' passion for artistry, but instead of carving stone, they view their bodies as living works of art. As they fly, coursing along wind currents or blowing through underground tunnels like living sandstorms, they create mesmerizing dances with their ever-shifting forms.
