# [Cinder Hulk](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\elemental/cinder-hulk-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 123*  

Cinder hulks are distant descendants of fire giants who isolated themselves from the world and steeped themselves in the energy of the Elemental Planes. Over the course of centuries, these giants were transformed into Elementals made of smoke and cinders. Half the size of their giant ancestors, cinder hulks maintain the basic physical shape of fire giants, but ash and embers billow around their barely cohesive physical forms.

Cinder hulks live in isolated enclaves in fiery locations on the Material Plane, in the Elemental Planes of Air and Fire, and especially in the Great Conflagration, the border region between those two planes. They retain none of the skills and motivation of their giant ancestors; they simply want to burn as much as they can until their own flames are extinguished. When a cinder hulk dies, it collapses into a billowing cloud of searing smoke.
