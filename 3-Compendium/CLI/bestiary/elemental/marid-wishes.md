- "desc": "The marid's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16,\
    \ +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring\
    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: create or destroy water, detect evil\
    \ and good, detect magic, fog cloud, purify food and drink\n\n1/day each:\
    \ conjure elemental ([water elemental](/3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md)\

  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The marid can breathe air and water."
  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam,\
    \ leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most\
    \ potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie\
    \ that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a\
    \ genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again\
    \ for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same\
    \ genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that\
    \ creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of\
    \ the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell\
    \ on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's\
    \ nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting\
    \ the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to\
    \ be to the genie's benefit."

    \ damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack."
  "name": "Trident"
- "desc": "The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide.\
    \ Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure,\
    \ a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is\
    \ pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a success, a\
    \ target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked\
    \ prone."
