- "desc": "The efreeti's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15,\
    \ +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring\
    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: detect magic\n\n1/day each: conjure\
    \ elemental ([fire elemental](/3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental-xmm.md)\
    \ only), gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire\n\n\
    3/day each: enlarge/reduce, tongues"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "If the efreeti dies, its body disintegrates in a flash of fire and puff\
    \ of smoke, leaving behind only equipment the efreeti was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most\
    \ potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie\
    \ that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a\
    \ genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again\
    \ for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same\
    \ genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that\
    \ creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of\
    \ the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell\
    \ on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's\
    \ nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting\
    \ the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to\
    \ be to the genie's benefit."
