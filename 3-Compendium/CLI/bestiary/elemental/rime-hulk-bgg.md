# [Rime Hulk](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\elemental/rime-hulk-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 162*  

Rime hulks are a withered branch of the frost giant family tree, descended from ancient giants who withdrew from the world and succumbed to their elemental nature. Most rime hulks dwell in the Frostfell, the "plane of ice" that forms the border between the Elemental Planes of Air and Water. Others lurk in isolated rifts in enormous polar glaciers.

Smaller and weaker than their ancestors, rime hulks are roughly formed masses of frost and ice. Their vaguely giant-shaped physical forms are unstable, constantly breaking apart and reforming as clouds of frost billow off them. As a rime hulk moves, it leaves a trail of ice that can freeze enemies in place. When it dies, a rime hulk explodes in a burst of frost.
