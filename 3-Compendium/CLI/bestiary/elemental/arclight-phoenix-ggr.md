# [Arclight Phoenix](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\elemental/arclight-phoenix-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 193*  

An arclight phoenix is variously said to be a byproduct of a lightning strike on an aviary, a mishap in an effort to create a translocation device, or a successful attempt to create an elemental creature in the form of a majestic bird.

Whatever its origin, an arclight phoenix looks like a bird of prey formed entirely of electrical energy. Lightning fans out behind it as it bolts from place to place through the sky, making up in speed what it lacks in grace and majesty. It seems happiest during natural thunderstorms, as it darts among the clouds, gliding alongside thunderbolts.

## Elemental Nature

An arclight phoenix doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
