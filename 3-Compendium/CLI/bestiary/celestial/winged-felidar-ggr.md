- "desc": "The felidar can magically bond with one creature it can see, right after\
    \ spending at least 1 hour observing that creature while within 30 feet of it.\
    \ The bond lasts until the felidar bonds with a different creature or until the\
    \ bonded creature dies. This bond has the following effects: The felidar and the\
    \ bonded creature can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance\
    \ of up to 100 feet. The felidar can sense the direction and distance to the bonded\
    \ creature if they're on the same plane of existence. As an action, the felidar\
    \ or the bonded creature can sense what the other sees and hears, during which\
    \ time it loses its own sight and hearing. This effect lasts until the start of\
    \ its next turn."
