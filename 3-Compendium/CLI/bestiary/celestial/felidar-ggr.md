# [Felidar](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\celestial/felidar-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 199*  

A felidar is a celestial creature whose nature reflects an inherent devotion to law and order. It resembles an enormous cat with two pairs of downward-sloping horns and prominent teeth. Its blue-gray hide has a silvery, geometric pattern, and its thick white mane falls in an orderly fashion around its shoulders.

Nearly every felidar forms a close bond with one other creature. Winged felidars almost always bond with archons, joining in their relentless pursuit of justice. Other felidars ally with members of the Azorius Senate and form bonds with high-ranking justiciars and ministers, aiding them in enforcing the law and tracking down criminals. Some Azorius felidars form bonds with important prisoners in Azorius custody, ensuring that the felidars can track down the felons if they escape custody.

    \ bonded creature dies. This bond has the following effects: The felidar and the\
    \ bonded creature can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance\
    \ of up to 100 feet. The felidar can sense the direction and distance to the bonded\
    \ creature if they're on the same plane of existence. As an action, the felidar\
    \ or the bonded creature can sense what the other sees and hears, during which\
    \ time it loses its own sight and hearing. This effect lasts until the start of\
    \ its next turn."
