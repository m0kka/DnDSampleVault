# [Silver Greatwyrm](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\dragon/silver-greatwyrm-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 208*  

Some of the oldest and wisest metallic dragons undergo a miraculous metamorphosis to become greatwyrms. This transformation is often wrought by Bahamut, who takes pride in elevating his worthiest children to a status approaching his own greatness.

A metallic greatwyrm's transformation often involves fusing the consciousness, the magic, and sometimes even the physical forms of multiple echoes of the same dragon across the worlds of the Material Plane. Several of the dragons identified as dragon gods—including Aasterinian (described in the "Brass Dragons" section of chapter 5), Lendys, and Tamara—are metallic greatwyrms who have combined the essences of multiple forms to achieve this godlike status.

Metallic greatwyrms are among the largest creatures in the multiverse, overshadowing most other dragons. Mighty elemental forces swirl around them in response to their wishes, and their breath weapons can sap the strength from armies—or lay waste to whole regions.

> [!note] Justice and Mercy
> 
> Lendys and Tamara are both silver greatwyrms, but they could not be more different from each other.
> 
> Lendys is renowned as an impartial judge who is equally ready to serve as jury and executioner when dragons commit grave injustices against dragonkind. He is lawful neutral, and he is said to be incapable of mercy or forgiveness.
> 
> Tamara, by contrast, embodies the ideal of mercy. She heals the sick, tends the injured, and delivers a peaceful departure to dragons nearing the end of their natural lives. She has a particular loathing for dracoliches and other draconic Undead.
