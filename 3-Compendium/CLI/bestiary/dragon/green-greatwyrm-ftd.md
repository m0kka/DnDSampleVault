# [Green Greatwyrm](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\dragon/green-greatwyrm-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 168*  

The most ancient chromatic dragons, who have survived over twelve hundred years of mortal life and acquired vast hoards worth millions of gold pieces, can achieve a form of apotheosis, reaching a level of power approaching that of Tiamat's mighty aspect. The competitive avarice of dragonkind and the interference of adventurers prevent most dragons from attaining this level of power. But a chromatic dragon who can outwit all rivals and overcome all potential thieves can rise to become one of the mightiest of dragons.

Often a chromatic greatwyrm's ascension involves fusing the power of a single dragon's echoes across different worlds of the Material Plane. The black greatwyrm Chronepsis, for example, is said to have stalked multiple worlds and devoured many of his echoes before withdrawing to a planar lair in the Outlands. The red greatwyrm Ashardalon worked with a balor to ritually drain the power of his echoes, then infused their power into himself by implanting the balor where his heart had been.

In both size and power, chromatic greatwyrms exceed even ancient dragons. The energy of their breath weapons courses over their bodies and glows under their scales, and elemental forces rage around them when they exert their wrath. They no longer need to eat or drink, as their vast hoards magically sustain them. And their power can raze a city to the ground, destroying buildings and defenders alike.
