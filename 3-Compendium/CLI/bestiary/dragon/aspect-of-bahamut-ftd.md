# [Aspect of Bahamut](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\dragon/aspect-of-bahamut-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 165*  

Known as the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut is the patron and progenitor of metallic dragons. Since fleeing the First World, he has made his home in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia and is often numbered among the gods of that plane. Adventurers and dragons alike pray to Bahamut to uphold honor and justice, or when they need courage to face a great threat. In the most dire situations, a powerful follower of Bahamut who makes a tremendous sacrifice—a vast hoard or even the follower's own life—might convince the god to send aid to the world in the form of a divine aspect. This aspect is a physical manifestation of the Platinum Dragon, carrying his memories and will—and a significant portion of his formidable strength.

Bahamut's aspect displays the full glory of the Platinum Dragon, towering over even ancient dragons. Covered in platinum scales, his physical features combine various elements of the five kinds of metallic dragons—according to some scholars, combining them in different ways with each manifestation of the aspect. But Bahamut is also fond of traveling the Material Plane in disguise, so his aspect might appear as a wizened old sage, a young monk, or a songbird. In any form, Bahamut's aspect is often accompanied by seven ancient gold dragons who favor disguising themselves as canaries.

In combat, Bahamut's enemies experience the full force of his justice, while his allies enjoy the full benefit of his mercy. His breath can wreak monumental destruction and work miraculous healing, and few things in the mortal world can cause him lasting harm.
