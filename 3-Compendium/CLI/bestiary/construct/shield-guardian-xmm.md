    \ call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian knows the distance and direction\

    \ When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined\
    \ by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters\
    \ set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast\
    \ or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost."
