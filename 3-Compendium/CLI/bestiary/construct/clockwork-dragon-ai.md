# [Clockwork Dragon](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\construct/clockwork-dragon-ai.md)
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 209*  

These intricately crafted constructs are typically made to reflect the forms of the metallic dragons. Plated in brass, bronze, copper, or faux gold and silver, they are often taken for fine draconic statues at first glance. A clockwork dragon makes a formidable guardian or defender, with its advanced intellect allowing it to be programmed with a wide range of orders, as well as being capable of wholly independent reactions to potential threats.

Though most clockwork dragons have a breath weapon that deals fire damage, some might be constructed to deal acid, cold, or lightning damage, depending on their makers' whims.
