# [Expeditious Messenger](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\construct/expeditious-messenger-erlw.md)
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 293*  

An expeditious messenger is a speedy flier, designed to quickly carry messages for its creator. Their speedy and efficient attitude makes expeditious messengers quite chatty, and they natter on as fast as they move.

These messengers come in a variety of forms, often looking like mechanical birds or sprites.

## Constructed Nature

A homunculus doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

A homunculus is a construct servant created for certain tasks. Artificers and wizards are responsible for most of the homunculi in existence.

Each kind of homunculus has a body constructed from different kinds of materials, including clay, iron, and bits of hair and feathers. The process that creates a homunculus sees those materials mixed with the creator's blood and animated through an extended magical ritual.
