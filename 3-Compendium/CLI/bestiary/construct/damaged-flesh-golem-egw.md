- "desc": "Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a\
    \ d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the\
    \ golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough\
    \ to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object\
    \ smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until\
    \ it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.\n\nThe golem's creator, if within\
    \ 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively.\
    \ The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make\
    \ a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases\
    \ being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the\
    \ golem might go berserk again."
