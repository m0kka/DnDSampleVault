# [Flesh Colossus](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\construct/flesh-colossus-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 141*  

During the dawn of the giants' empires, twisted minds sought to make their fallen comrades continue their service. Wizard giants stitched and wove the flesh of various giants over an adamantine skeleton, creating a grisly colossal construct. Inside the flesh colossus's chest is a stone sphere infused with spirits from each elemental plane acting as its core.

To this day, some of these ancient flesh colossi guard abandoned ruins, sites sacred to giants, and lost treasuresâ€”and possibly the procedure to create new examples of their kind.

    \ If the core is destroyed, the colossus regurgitates all swallowed creatures,\
    \ each of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the colossus and has the prone\
    \ condition, and the colossus can no longer swallow a creature. If the colossus\
    \ dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the restrained condition and can\
    \ escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting with the prone condition."
