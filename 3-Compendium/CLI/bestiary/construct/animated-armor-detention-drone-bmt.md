# [Animated Armor Detention Drone](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\construct/animated-armor-detention-drone-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 135*  

Detention drones vary in size, strength, and shape, though most are shaped like some kind of mechanical animal or plant.

- "desc": "The drone launches a tiny orb of magical force at a creature it can see\
    \ within 30 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution\
    \ saving throw or be encased in the orb, which expands to a size just large enough\
    \ to contain the creature. While encased, the creature doesn't need to breathe,\
    \ eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Nothing can pass through the orb, nor can\
    \ any creature teleport or use planar travel to enter or exit the orb. As a bonus\
    \ action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to 30 feet in any direction.\
    \ A successful casting of the Dispel Magic spell on the orb (DC 15) destroys it.\
    \ The orb otherwise remains intact until the drone spends an action to end the\
    \ effect or the drone is destroyed. A drone can have only one detention orb active\
    \ at a time; if the drone creates a detention orb when it already has one active,\
    \ the first orb disappears, freeing the creature inside."
