# [Winged Thrull](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\construct/winged-thrull-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 221*  

Winged thrulls are at once the most intelligent of Orzhov thrulls (which isn't saying much), as well as the smallest, most unobtrusive, and most mobile. They act as messengers and spies for their Orzhov masters and tend to mimic the mannerisms and movements of the oligarchs they serve.

## Thrulls

When the Orzhov Syndicate rips a soul from its body to create a spirit, the cast-off remains go to the fleshmages, who use their necromantic magic to liquefy the corpse and transform it into something useful. These creations become thrulls, obedient slaves that serve in a variety of menial roles: laborers, messengers, beasts of burden, and even fashion accessories for the elite. Whatever tasks they perform, they wear faceplates forged from devalued coinage to conceal their ghastly features.

### Construct Nature

A thrull doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
