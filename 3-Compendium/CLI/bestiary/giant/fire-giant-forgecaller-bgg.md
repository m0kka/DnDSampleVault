# [Fire Giant Forgecaller](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\giant/fire-giant-forgecaller-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 138*  

A fire giant who masters traditional rune magic can control the heat of a volcanic environment and conjure raw elemental energy of fire and magma. In a fire giant community, these forgecallers oversee both forges and the community's defense, often in Surtur's name. Some forgecallers prefer to live and work in isolation, seeking the hottest fires in volcanoes' hearts or the Elemental Plane of Fire to pursue their own crafts and studies.

A forgecaller is a walking furnace, clad head to toe in plate armor that seems to barely contain intense heat and billowing smoke. They conjure waves of magma and can fly by jetting magical fire from their legs and body.

    \ bearing the rune has AC 15; 40 hit points; and immunity to necrotic, poison,\

    \ As an action, a creature can make a DC 19 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing\
    \ itself or a creature within its reach from the rock on a success. The rock restraining\
