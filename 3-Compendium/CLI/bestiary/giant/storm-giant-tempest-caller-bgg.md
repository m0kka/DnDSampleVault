# [Storm Giant Tempest Caller](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\giant/storm-giant-tempest-caller-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 182*  

While most storm giants care little for the intricate details of ranking in the ordning, tempest callers proudly claim a position at the pinnacle of that rankingâ€”and few dare to challenge them. Wielding the power of rune magic in addition to the innate magic that courses through them, these storm giants are highly respected. If any giant can draw Annam's attention to the world, it would likely be a tempest caller.

Tempest callers implant crystal balls inscribed with the storm rune into their foreheads or eye sockets, allowing them to see through magical deception. They can also create a momentary vortex of freezing winds and storm clouds around themselves, engulfing their foes in elemental fury.
