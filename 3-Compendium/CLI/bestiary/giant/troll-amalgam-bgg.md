# [Troll Amalgam](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\giant/troll-amalgam-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 186*  

A troll amalgam forms when multiple trolls fuse together during regeneration. This sometimes occurs when many trolls are slain in a single battle, when troll parts are thrown into charnel pits or mass graves, or through twisted rituals of wicked spellcasters. Sometimes troll worshipers of Vaprak hear a call to gather in the Underdark and perform a gruesome rite that fuses them into an amalgam that is regarded as an avatar of their fearsome god.

A troll amalgam is a misshapen mass of rubbery flesh, claws, and faces. If a creature tries to attack it from beyond its reach or to escape through a small tunnel, the troll amalgam tears off a piece of its own body and hurls it at the creature. These body parts eventually regenerate into full trolls, and sometimes they regather and combine into a new troll amalgam.

## Trolls

The dwarven tale titled*The Saga of Gnarldan Steelshield*claims the god Vaprak the Destroyer came into being when Annam was injured and his blood spilled on the ground. The saga further claims that trolls were born similarly when Vaprak's blood was spilled. Whatever the truth of their origin, trolls embody life's steadfast determination to grow and thrive despite all obstacles.

Trolls' rapid healing makes them subject to bizarre mutations, particularly when they regenerate in unusual environments or heal from extraordinary magical wounds. Troll amalgams and troll mutates are two examples of such strangely mutated forms.
