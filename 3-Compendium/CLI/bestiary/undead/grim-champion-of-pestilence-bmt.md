# [Grim Champion of Pestilence](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\undead/grim-champion-of-pestilence-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 163*  

Aleron was once a tiefling adventurer, but unlike so many victims of the Deck of Many Things, he never drew the Skull card. Instead, when one of his allies drew the card and faced the avatar of death, Aleron came to his ally's aid. A second avatar of death appeared, and Aleron was slain; soon after, his Undead corpse crawled from Withered Vineyard, tainted with plague. Aleron resents his fellow Undead in the Grim Harrow, considering himself better than all of them and unjustly condemned to the Gardens of Decay for an act of altruism.

Though the weakest of the Harrow's three leaders, the Grim Champion of Pestilence is nonetheless a fearsome entity of sickness and blight. A swarm of insects surrounds him in a mockery of a halo, and debilitating plagues flow from his fingertips. Aleron rides a warhorse skeleton with flies buzzing in its gaping eye sockets.

## The Grim Champions

The Grim Harrow is led by three powerful entities with the title of grim champion. Each champion embodies a terrible facet of death. Jyn Corvis, Grim Champion of Desolation, is the oldest and most powerful of the three and embodies all-consuming nothingness. She led the Grim Harrow to the Gardens of Delight long ago and is the nominal leader of all the Undead in the demiplane. The other two champions—Wynemar Brack, Grim Champion of Bloodshed, and Aleron, Grim Champion of Pestilence—rival Jyn for power and together can oppose her. The fact that the three champions rarely agree on anything is a major check on the group's power. Instead of the Grim Harrow acting as a unified force, each of the three champions usually pursues their own interests, seldom cooperating or sharing intelligence or resources.
