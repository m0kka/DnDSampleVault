# [Draconic Shard](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\undead/draconic-shard-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 181*  

Gem dragons wield psionic power, and when a powerful gem dragon perishes, the force of the dragon's will and mind sometimes refuses to pass on. This essence lingers in the form of a psychic remnant called a draconic shard.

A draconic shard in its true form resembles a shimmering, spectral image of the dragon. More often, though, a shard inhabits an object the gem dragon poured psionic power intoâ€”typically a weapon or other item from the dragon's hoard. In this vessel, a draconic shard continues to pursue the interests and struggles that drove the dragon, perhaps even accompanying adventurers in the guise of an intelligent magic item and steering them to fulfill the dragon's designs.

A draconic shard is difficult to destroy. Destroying the shard's spectral form or an object the shard inhabits forces the spirit into the form of a cracked gemstone while the spirit slowly regains strength. Only if that stone is destroyed can the shard be put to rest.

- "desc": "The shard disappears as it pours its psychic essence into a Medium or smaller\

    \ The object uses the shard's AC, and any damage dealt to the object applies to\
    \ the shard's hit points. The shard inhabits the object until it uses an action\
    \ to leave; until it is turned; until it is reduced to 0 hit points; or until\
    \ an effect that ends possession, such as a dispel evil and good spell, is used\
    \ on it. When it leaves the object, it reappears in the nearest unoccupied space.\n\
    \nWhile inhabited, the object becomes a magic item if it wasn't already, and a\
    \ Tiny cracked gemstone matching the kind of gem dragon the shard was in life\
    \ appears somewhere on the object. The shard can cause the object to fly using\
    \ the shard's own flying speed, use its senses, speak verbally or telepathically,\
    \ cast spells, and use its legendary actions.\n\nIf a creature wears or carries\
    \ the inhabited object, the shard can grant the creature the following benefits:\n\
    \nEach of the creature's attacks deals an extra 1d8 force damage on a hit.\n\n\
    The creature gains resistance to psychic damage."
