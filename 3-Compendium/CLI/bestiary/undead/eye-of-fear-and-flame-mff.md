# [Eye of Fear and Flame](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\undead/eye-of-fear-and-flame-mff.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen's Fiendish Folio p. 8*  

An eye of fear and flame stalks the world of the living, commanding individuals to perform evil deeds of the undead's choosing or be destroyed. If its commands are not obeyed, an eye of fear and flame throws back its hood to reveal its skull—set with gems of red and black in each eye socket—then attacks.

## Spectral Visage

An eye of fear and flame resembles a hooded, skeletal humanoid figure. The interior of its hood cannot be seen except as an opaque black void. Ominous tales speak of these creatures prowling city streets in the darkest nights and during times of unease and unrest. It is said that eyes of fear and flame were created by chaotic gods to foment the destruction of lawful creatures, or by lawful gods for the testing of their followers. Rumors state that only twenty of these creatures exist, but much of the truth about them remains unknown.

## Cruel Puppet Masters

An eye of fear and flame often chooses to appear during times of uncertainty, such as after a group's devastating defeat or when an individual contemplates some momentous decision. The undead seeks to corrupt vulnerable individuals, especially those of lawful or good alignments, by setting tasks that test its targets' moral foundations. A paladin might be ordered to murder an innocent, with the argument that not doing so will result in some greater evil taking place. Ultimately, the success or failure of the task is of less interest to the eye of fear and flame than the instigation of the evil act—and the general spread of chaos and misery that comes with it.

## Mystic Gemstones

An eye of fear and flame casts its magic powers through its gemstone eyes. In combat, it targets not only its opponents but also innocent bystanders, seeking to cause the greatest amount of confusion and destruction. If the creature is destroyed, these gems can be recovered, though they are treated as dangerous, cursed trophies akin to a demilich's soul gems. Still, they might be sold to certain discerning—and brazen—collectors.
