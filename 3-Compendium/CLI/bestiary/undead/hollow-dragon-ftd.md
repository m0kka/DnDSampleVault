# [Hollow Dragon](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\undead/hollow-dragon-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 206*  

Unlike dragons who explore the magic of undeath for power, some metallic dragons see undeath as a means to pursue a noble purpose. For the sake of protecting an artifact or fulfilling an oath, a dragon might transform into a hollow dragon, accepting undeath until that purpose is fulfilled.

As the name suggests, a hollow dragon is the husk of a metallic dragon's hide, filled with radiant energy. Depending on the dragon's original kind, that energy might take the appearance of flames, lightning, or misty vapors.

Hollow dragons don't suffer distractions from their undying purpose. So powerful is their drive that their bodies reconstitute if destroyed.

When they fulfill their purpose, most hollow dragons embrace the death they have staved off for so long. But others seek new tasks to sustain themselvesâ€”or cling to undeath out of sheer stubbornness or habit.
