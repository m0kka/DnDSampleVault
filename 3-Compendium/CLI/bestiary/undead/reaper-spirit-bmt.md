"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The spirit targets a creature it can see within 10 feet of itself and begins\

    \ and distance to the target if it is on the same plane of existence as you. Additionally,\
    \ if the target starts its turn within 10 feet of the spirit, the target must\
    \ succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have the frightened\
    \ condition until the start of the target's next turn. The target remains haunted\
    \ until it dies, the spirit disappears, or the spirit uses this action again."
