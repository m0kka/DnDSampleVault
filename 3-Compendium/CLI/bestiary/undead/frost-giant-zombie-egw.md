# [Frost Giant Zombie](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\undead/frost-giant-zombie-egw.md)
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 288*  

An unknown Aeorian object of immense power and mystery was uncovered and brought to the Fortress of the Dead Jarl in Eiselcross to please the ruling frost giant, Conessa Berg. The object's unstable nature unleashed a burst of corroding arcane power, ravaging the denizens of the stronghold with twisting necromantic energies, transforming them into monstrous, rime-infused undead. These hulking brutes now wander the ruined landscape surrounding their cursed home, hunting and destroying all living things with a frightening ferocity.

The battered, butchered, and frozen remains of would-be heroes litter battle sites where these undead giants have been encountered. Underestimating these towering horrors has been the folly of numerous expeditions to the northern reaches of Eiselcross, with only rumors often finding their way back as proof that these frigid monsters even exist.
