# [Boggle](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\fey/boggle-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 65, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 128*  

Boggles are the little bogeys of fairy tales. They lurk in the fringes of the Feywild and are also found on the Material Plane, where they hide under beds and in closets, waiting to frighten and bedevil folk with their mischief.

Boggles are born out of feelings of loneliness. They materialize when a sapient being feels isolated or abandoned near a place where the Feywild touches the world. For example, a forsaken child might unintentionally conjure a boggle and see them as a sort of imaginary friend. A boggle might also appear in the attic of a lonely widower's house or in a hermit's cave.

Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse themselves, using the oil they excrete to cause trouble. A boggle also isn't above breaking dishes, hiding tools, startling cows to decrease their milk, or hiding a baby in an attic. Although a boggle's antics might cause distress and unintentional harm, mischief—not mayhem—is usually the intent. If threatened, a boggle flees rather than stand and fight.

A boggle can create magical openings to travel short distances or to pilfer items that would otherwise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift in space, a boggle must be adjacent to a space defined by a frame, such as an open window or a doorway, a gap between the bars of a cage, or the opening between the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is invisible and disappears after a few seconds—just enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through it.
