- "desc": "While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another,\
    \ they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must\
    \ share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n1st level (4 slots): identify,\
    \ ray of sickness\n\n2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n\n3rd\
    \ level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n\n4th level\
    \ (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n\n5th level (2 slots): contact\
    \ other plane, scrying\n\n6th level (1 slots): eyebite\n\nFor casting these\
    \ spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting\
    \ ability. The spell save DC 13, and the spell attack bonus is +5."

    \ illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid\
    \ shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she\
    \ dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection.\
    \ For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching\
    \ her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to\
    \ visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation)\
    \ check to discern that the hag is disguised."
  "name": "Illusory Appearance"
- "desc": "The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or\
    \ until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible,\
    \ she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by\
    \ magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her."
