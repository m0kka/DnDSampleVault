- "desc": "Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically\
    \ into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within\
    \ 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of\

- "desc": "The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet\
    \ of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted\
    \ friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's\
    \ control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way\
    \ it can.\n\nEach time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target,\
    \ it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise,\
    \ the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of\
    \ existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's\
    \ saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm for\
    \ the next 24 hours.\n\nThe dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to\
    \ three beasts charmed at a time."
