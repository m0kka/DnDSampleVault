- "desc": "The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She\
    \ can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\n\
    At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The hag can breathe air and water."
  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears\
    \ the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight)\
    \ check."

  "name": "Claws"
- "desc": "The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical\
    \ illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid\
    \ shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she\
    \ dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection.\
    \ For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching\
    \ her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to\
    \ visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation)\
    \ check to discern that the hag is disguised."
  "name": "Illusory Appearance"
- "desc": "The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or\
    \ until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible,\
    \ she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by\
    \ magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her."
