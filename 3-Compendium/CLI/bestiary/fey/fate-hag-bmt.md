# [Fate Hag](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\fey/fate-hag-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 176*  

Fate hags are servants of destiny that mostly reside in the Feywild and Shadowfell or near crossings to those realms from the Material Plane. The aspects of fate to which a fate hag is most attuned depends on the plane where the hag dwellsâ€”hopeful and prosperous in the Feywild or dire and doomed in the Shadowfell.

Fate hags carry gleaming magical shears they use to snip strands of fate. These shears are frightful weapons, severing a foe's destiny as well as its flesh. Fate hags often glimpse others' destinies when truths are revealed to them, when they lay curses, and when they offer divinations; they delight in such glimpses and are compelled to speak of what they see. Those who dare harm a fate hag find silvery threads of destiny winding around their bodies, tightening and slicing deeper as fate turns against the hag's foes.
