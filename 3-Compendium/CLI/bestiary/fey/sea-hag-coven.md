    \ ray of sickness\n\n2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n\n3rd\

    \ ability. The spell save DC 13, and the spell attack bonus is +5."

- "desc": "The hag can breathe air and water."
  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see\
    \ the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,\
    \ the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw\
    \ at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line\
    \ of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw\
    \ is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's\
    \ Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\n\nUnless the target is surprised\
    \ or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its\
    \ eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next\
    \ turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against\
    \ the hag."

  "name": "Death Glare"
- "desc": "The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical\
    \ illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid\
    \ shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\n\
    \nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For\
    \ example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand\
    \ might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually\
    \ inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check\
    \ to discern that the hag is disguised."
