One of the many predators to stalk the marshlands and muddy foothills of Xhorhas, moorbounders are known as dangerous killers to those who try to avoid them on their travelsâ€”and as prized mounts for those willing to capture and train them. Though the process of domesticating a moorbounder is fraught with peril, these creatures can become favored hunting companions and powerful war mounts.

## Natural Hunters

Moorbounders hunt with elongated tusks and retractable claws. With a vague resemblance to large hunting cats, their muscular bodies are built for combat, granting them incredible prowess at leaping and a running speed that makes them dominant carnivores.
