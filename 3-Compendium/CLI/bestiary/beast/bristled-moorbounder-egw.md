# [Bristled Moorbounder](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\beast/bristled-moorbounder-egw.md)
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 295*  

A weird and deadly offshoot of the moorbounder has rows of long, bladelike bristles covering its sleek body. The creature weaponizes these blades, using them to slash nearby creatures to ribbons. However, these blades make the bristled moorbounder less suitable as a mount.

One of the many predators to stalk the marshlands and muddy foothills of Xhorhas, moorbounders are known as dangerous killers to those who try to avoid them on their travelsâ€”and as prized mounts for those willing to capture and train them. Though the process of domesticating a moorbounder is fraught with peril, these creatures can become favored hunting companions and powerful war mounts.

## Natural Hunters

Moorbounders hunt with elongated tusks and retractable claws. With a vague resemblance to large hunting cats, their muscular bodies are built for combat, granting them incredible prowess at leaping and a running speed that makes them dominant carnivores.
