# [Frost Worm](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/frost-worm-egw.md)
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 289*  

Frost worms burrow through the snow, dirt, ice, and rock of Wildemount's Biting North. These enormous monstrosities eagerly consume any living creature they can wrap their jaws around.

A frost worm spends most of its time beneath the frozen ground, conserving energy while it waits for prey to pass overhead. Smart travelers can identify a frost worm's hunting grounds by looking for recently iced-over tunnels. When the worm senses vibrations above, it bursts forth through dirt, ice, and snow. Those who escape its initial assault must still contend with the worm's haunting trillâ€”a hypnotizing call that stops creatures in their tracks to make them easy prey.
