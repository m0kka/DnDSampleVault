    \ within 5 feet of it. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys\
    \ a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the\
    \ creature can make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the rust monster's\
    \ touch.\n\nIf the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being\
    \ worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it\
    \ offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is\
    \ destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described\
    \ in the Rust Metal trait."
