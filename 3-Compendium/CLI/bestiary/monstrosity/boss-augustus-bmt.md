# [Boss Augustus](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/boss-augustus-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 82*  

Augustus is a hulking human werewolf of few words. He shares leadership of the guild with Boss Delour and has a knack for planning heists. Guild members consider him a brutal but fair leader. Some perceptive guild members—like Kathra Bitterwind—have noticed he's become more reclusive recently, and when he does appear, he's restless.

Augustus is a natural-born lycanthrope, born to werewolf parents. His parents were slain by monster hunters when he was young, and he traveled from town to town for most of his life, fleeing whenever townsfolk discovered his true nature.

Delour and Pyrite accepted Augustus in a way he'd never experienced before. When the three of them created the Moonstalkers guild, Augustus relished his new life of crime. But over time, his passion has faded. The riches they gathered mean nothing to him now. The violence grates on him, and he no longer empathizes with Delour's fantasies of revenge. Instead, Augustus secretly longs to end his curse and integrate into society.

Only a Wish spell can end Augustus's curse. He has ordered Wanewort, a night hag, to find anyone with access to that spell and plans to offer anything in his power in exchange for undoing his curse. And if bargaining doesn't work, there's always blackmail. (See the " Using the Moonstalkers in Your Campaign " section in chapter 11 for more details.)
