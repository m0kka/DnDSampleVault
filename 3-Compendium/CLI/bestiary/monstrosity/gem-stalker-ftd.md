# [Gem Stalker](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/gem-stalker-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 202*  

When a gem dragon kills an aberrant creature from the Far Realm, the dragon sometimes reshapes the alien corpse into a gem stalkerâ€”a cunning predator capable of traversing the Underdark, hunting Aberrations, and guarding its creator's lair. A gem stalker is imbued with life, sapience, and purpose by the mystical energy of the gem dragon's breath, and it is dedicated to its mission.

A gem stalker has a four-legged body resembling that of a wingless dragon, but with a vaguely humanlike torso, head, and arms in place of the dragon's head. Its eyes are milk white, it has no mouth, and its skin is studded with bright crystals that pulse with psychic energy. These crystals give the gem stalker its telepathy, as well as its ability to fling crystal darts and create a protective link that can ward other creatures against harm.
