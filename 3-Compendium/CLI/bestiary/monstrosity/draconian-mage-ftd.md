# [Draconian Mage](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/draconian-mage-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 179*  

Draconians born from the eggs of bronze, green, and emerald dragons have some ability to wield magic. They often lead small groups of draconian foot soldiers, using their magic to snipe across the battlefield or aid their allies' incursions and attacks. They have wings that allow them to glide during a fall.

When draconian mages die, their flesh shrivels away before their bones explode, sending a shower of magical splinters in all directions.

On the world of Krynn, draconian mages formed from bronze dragon eggs are called bozak draconians.

## Draconians

Draconians are bipedal monsters born from dragon eggs that have been corrupted or warped by powerful magic. Most often, this corruption is a deliberate act, the work of an aspiring tyrant seeking to transform stolen eggs into a draconian army. A single corrupted egg yields several draconians of the same kind. A draconian might be taken for a dragonborn at first glance, though most kinds of draconians have wings.

When draconians die, they do not go quietly. Instead, their lifeless bodies unleash a last act of magical violence.
