    \ the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and\
    \ other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the\
    \ start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on\
    \ a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25\
    \ Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed\
    \ creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the\
    \ kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape\

  "name": "Tentacle"
- "desc": "One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is\
    \ thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target\
    \ strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every\
    \ 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature\
    \ must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be\
    \ knocked prone."
  "name": "Fling"
- "desc": "The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can\
    \ strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make\

    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

- "desc": "While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The\
    \ cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures\
    \ other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn\
    \ there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison\
    \ damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong\
    \ current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's\
    \ next turn."
