- "desc": "When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30\
    \ feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving\
    \ throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving\
    \ throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a\
    \ creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The\
    \ restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn,\
    \ becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification\
    \ lasts until the creature is freed by the  greater restoration spell or other\
    \ magic.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving\
    \ throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa\
    \ until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature\
    \ looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\n\n\
    If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it\
    \ and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by\
    \ its own gaze."
