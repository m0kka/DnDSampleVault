# [Regisaur](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/regisaur-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 130*  

Aptly called "the ruler of dinosaurs," a regisaur is an enormous predator large enough to swallow a giant whole. Fiery veins of elemental energy course through its skin and glow in its eyes and nostrils.

## Dinosaurs

When Annam's children first began to populate the worlds of the Material Plane, the All-Father created behemoth dinosaurs to live alongside them as companions. The primeval magic used to create the dinosaurs still thrums through their being and manifests in colorful, scar-like lines on their towering bodies. Some of these ancient dinosaurs persist in timeless jungles, hidden enclaves, and other lands untouched by the rest of the world.
