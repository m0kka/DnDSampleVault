    \ saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning\
    \ damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature\
    \ takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of\
    \ the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no\
    \ unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette's\
