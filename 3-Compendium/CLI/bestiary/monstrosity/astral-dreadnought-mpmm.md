# [Astral Dreadnought](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/astral-dreadnought-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 51, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 117*  

Enormous and terrifying, astral dreadnoughts haunt the silvery void of the Astral Plane, causing planar travelers to shudder at the very thought of them. Dreadnoughts have been gliding through the astral mists since the dawn of the multiverse, trying to devour all other creatures they encounter.

Covered from head to tail in layers of thick, spiked plates, a dreadnought has two gnarled limbs that end in magic-enhanced pincer claws. Constellations appear to swirl in the depths of its single eye, and its serpentine tail trails off into the silvery void. Anything it swallows is deposited in a unique demiplaneâ€”an enclosed space that contains eons worth of detritus, as well as the remains of travelers. The place has gravity and breathable air, and organic matter decays there. When the dreadnought dies, its demiplane vanishes, and its contents are released into the Astral Plane.

- "desc": "The dreadnought's eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic\
    \ field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, it decides\
    \ which way the cone faces. The cone doesn't function while the eye is closed\

- "desc": "Anything the dreadnought swallows is transported to a demiplane that can\
    \ be entered by no other means except a wish spell or the dreadnought's Bite and\
    \ Donjon Visit. A creature can leave the demiplane only by using magic that enables\
    \ planar travel, such as the plane shift spell. The demiplane resembles a stone\
    \ cave roughly 1,000 feet in diameter with a ceiling 100 feet high. Like a stomach,\
    \ it contains the remains of past meals. The dreadnought can't be harmed from\
    \ within the demiplane. If the dreadnought dies, the demiplane disappears, and\
    \ everything inside it appears around the dreadnought's corpse. The demiplane\
    \ is otherwise indestructible."

  "name": "Legendary Resistance (3/Day)"

    \ (5d10 + 9) force damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature and this\
    \ damage reduces it to 0 hit points or it is incapacitated, the dreadnought swallows\
    \ it. The swallowed target, along with everything it is wearing and carrying,\
    \ appears in an unoccupied space on the floor of the Demiplanar Donjon."

    \ turn, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if\
    \ that space is occupied."
  "name": "Donjon Visit (Costs 2 Actions)"
- "desc": "Each creature within 60 feet of the dreadnought must make a DC 19 Wisdom\
