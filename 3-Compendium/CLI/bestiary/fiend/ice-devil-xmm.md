- "desc": "The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can\
    \ see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and\
    \ 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.\n\nWhen\
    \ the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest\
    \ route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the\
    \ creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage\
    \ on a successful one.\n\nThe wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated\
    \ or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5,\
    \ 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic,\
    \ poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet\
    \ of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving\
    \ through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must\
    \ make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed\
    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates\
    \ when the rest of the wall vanishes."
