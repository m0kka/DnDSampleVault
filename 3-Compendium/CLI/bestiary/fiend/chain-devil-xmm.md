- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6\
    \ + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if the devil isn't\
    \ already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained\
    \ and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns."
  "name": "Chain"
- "desc": "Up to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout\
    \ razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's control, provided that the chains\
    \ aren't being worn or carried.\n\nEach animated chain is an object with AC 20,\
    \ 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder\
    \ damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated\
    \ chain to make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one\
    \ creature of its own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain\
    \ reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is\
    \ incapacitated or dies."

- "desc": "When a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 30 feet of the\
    \ devil, the devil can create the illusion that it looks like one of the creature's\
    \ departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see the devil, it\
    \ must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of\
    \ its turn."
