# [Flind](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\fiend/flind-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 127, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 153*  

When the demon lord Yeenoghu wants to create a particularly fearsome war band leader, he transforms an excep tionally strong and vicious gnoll into a demonic warrior known as a flind.

A war band of demon-worshiping gnolls typically contains only one flind, and that creature sets the war band's path. Because of its special connection to Yeenoghu, a flind uses demonic insight to guide the gnolls toward weak prey ripe for slaughter.

Unlike other leaders who might skulk behind their minions, a flind leads the charge in battle. Its flail causes wracking pain, paralysis, and disorientation in those it strikes.
