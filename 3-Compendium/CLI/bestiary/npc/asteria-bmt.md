# [Asteria](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\npc/asteria-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 188*  

Though she now travels alone, Asteria still draws much of her power from her bond with Euryale. Asteria is foremost a protector and warrior, traveling the multiverse to uproot injustice, defend innocents, and inspire hope. She believes everyone deserves a chance to write their own story on their own terms, and her deeds have inspired countless heroic tales.

Even after so many years, Asteria maintains a joyous wanderlust and passion for discovery. She's as likely to be found climbing trees or poring over arcane texts as she is brandishing her sword in battle. Anyone who engages Asteria in conversation about her interests finds her an overflowing font of information. But she also retains her stubborn streak and quickly repudiates anyone who tries to order her around.

Asteria hasn't aged since Istus drew her future from the first Deck of Many Things. She doesn't know why this is but surmises her life is tied to that deck; so long as it continues to exist, so will she. She has no way to prove this hypothesis, but she nevertheless opposes groups like the Grim Harrow (see chapter 19) that seek to destroy the*Deck of Many Things*.
