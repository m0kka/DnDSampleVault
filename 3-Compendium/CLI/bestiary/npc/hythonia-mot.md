# [Hythonia](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\npc/hythonia-mot.md)
*Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 252*  

Theros's reclusive medusas often delight in collecting and expanding their galleries of petrified victims. Unlike other medusas, Hythonia isn't merely a collector; she's an artist.

When Hythonia came to the island of Skathos, the inhabitants worshiped her as an avatar of the god Pharika. The cultists eagerly offered themselves up to the medusa's petrifying gaze in hopes of gaining Pharika's favor. Seeing herself surrounded by willing devotees, Hythonia formulated a cruel plan. After encouraging them to engage in wild rituals, Hythonia began turning her followers to stone, weaving their forms to create a grisly throne made of their petrified bodies.

While the medusa's victims have dwindled, tales of the medusa queen and the divine secrets she hoards have not. Hythonia eagerly trades the mysteries she knows but demands a constant price: a beautiful individual to become part of her throne.

  "name": "Legendary Resistance (3/Day)"
- "desc": "When a creature that can see Hythonia's eyes starts its turn within 30\
    \ feet of her, Hythonia can force it to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw\
    \ if she isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails\
    \ by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, on a failed save\
    \ the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature\
    \ must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified\
    \ on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until\
    \ the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless\
    \ surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start\
    \ of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Hythonia until the start\
    \ of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at\
    \ Hythonia in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If Hythonia sees\
    \ herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area\
    \ of bright light, she is affected by her own gaze."

    \ Each statue attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +11 bonus to hit\
    \ and dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If a Medium or smaller creature\
    \ takes this damage, it is also grappled (escape DC 15).  \n- Hythonia causes\
    \ spectral snakes to erupt from a point she can see within 150 feet of her. Each\
    \ creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving\
    \ throw or take 5 (2d4) piercing damage and become poisoned until the end of its\
    \ next turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature has disadvantage on Intelligence\
    \ checks and Intelligence saving throws, and it behaves as if under the effect\

  "name": ""
"mythic_encounter":
- "desc": "Hythonia serves as a potent threat against even high-level characters,\
    \ but you can increase the challenge by using the Shed Skin trait. When this happens,\
    \ Hythonia heals many of her wounds and slips away from danger, and then she can\
    \ choose one of her mythic actions when she uses a legendary action."
  "name": ""
- "desc": "You might foreshadow Hythonia using her mythic trait by describing her\
    \ skin cracking and turning pale as she suffers wounds. Read or paraphrase the\
    \ following text when Hythonia finally uses her Shed Skin trait:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "\n> The medusa's skin cracks, turns a lifeless gray, and shatters! The\
    \ monster crumbles to dust—but what clatters to the ground isn't scale and bone,\
    \ but hollow stone. The sound of rippling coils precedes the medusa rising up\
    \ anew, the last of her shed skin dropping away, revealing glistening, unscarred\
    \ scales."
  "name": ""
- "desc": "Fighting Hythonia as a mythic encounter is equivalent to taking on two\
