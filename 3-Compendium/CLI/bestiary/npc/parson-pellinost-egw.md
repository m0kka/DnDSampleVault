# [Parson Pellinost](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\npc/parson-pellinost-egw.md)
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 261*  

Commander Struther Felmont and the Dwendalian soldiers at the fort have grown callous and cruel under the leadership of Imperial Inquisitor Parson Pellinost, who conducts deranged experiments on the humanoids of the marsh with an unsavory and sadistic application of divine magic. The guards of Fort Venture engage in defense, training, and patrol work in eight-hour shifts. Few of those guards respect Pellinost, but all obey him for fear of strict retribution.

Pellinost has a prosthetic limb (right hand).
