# [Tromokratis](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\npc/tromokratis-mot.md)
*Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 254*  

Most krakens roam the seas, shattering hulls and scattering fleets, but the kraken Tromokratis notoriously vents its wrath on coastal settlements. Whether it acts at the command of the god Thassa or to sate its own hunger, Tromokratis numbers among the most feared threats in the sea, having no fixed lair and wandering where it will. In recent memory, the massive menace rose from the waves to topple the Pyrgnos, Meletis's great repository of scholarly knowledge. Since that day, the polis keeps a watch specifically for Tromokratis.

- "desc": "When Tromokratis is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious.\
    \ Instead, the damage creates cracks in its carapace, revealing its hearts. Tromokratis\

    \ tail. A heart has an AC of 22 and 100 hit points. It is immune to bludgeoning,\

    \ conditions. If it is forced to make a saving throw, treat its ability scores\
    \ as 10 (+0). If it finishes a short or long rest, the carapace heals, any destroyed\

  "name": "Tentacle Grasp"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 29 (3d12\
    \ + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled\
    \ by Tromokratis, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed,\
    \ the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and\
    \ other effects outside Tromokratis, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the\
    \ start of each of Tromokratis's turns. If Tromokratis takes 50 damage or more\
    \ on a single turn from a creature inside it, Tromokratis must succeed on a DC\
    \ 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed\
    \ creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of Tromokratis. If Tromokratis\
    \ dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from\
    \ the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."
