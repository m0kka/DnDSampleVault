# [The Lord of Blades](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\npc/the-lord-of-blades-erlw.md)
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 300*  

The Lord of Blades is a warforged warlord who has broken all ties with his former masters. He has established a nation for his people deep in the Mournland, centered in a great fortress where warforged from all over Khorvaire can come and feel a sense of belonging. No one knows what the Lord of Blades plans for his followers, but many fear that he intends to build a legion of warforged zealots, primed to march from the Mournland to unleash destruction on their former masters.

Some tales assert that the Lord of Blades led the warforged armies of Cyre in the Last War. Others cast him as a newer warforged, perhaps the last to come out of the Cannith creation forges before the Thronehold Accords led to their dismantling. One story claims the Lord of Blades caused the destruction of Cyre and warns that he plans to repeat the Day of Mourning in each of the remaining Five Nations. Whatever the truth, he has become a beacon for warforged everywhere.

## Warforged Nature

The Lord of Blades doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
