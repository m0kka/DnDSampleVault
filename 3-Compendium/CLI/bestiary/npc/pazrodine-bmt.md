# [Pazrodine](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\npc/pazrodine-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 113*  

Pazrodine, a moonstone dragon with a peaceful demeanor, oversees Seelie Market. A consummate traveler, she is always searching for fey crossings, which she uses to travel between the Feywild and the Material Plane. Moonstone dragons are detailed further in Fizban's Treasury of Dragons.

Pazrodine never stays in one place for long, and she wants to see all the wonders the Feywild and Material Plane have to offer. Curious Fey asked to join her caravan, and before long, she had a menagerie of merchants accompanying her on her travels. Pazrodine came to view these Fey merchants as her children. Their eager joy helps the dragon see the multiverse from new perspectives.

When Seelie Market lands, its vendors gather rocks, leaves, and sticks to make an enormous nest for Pazrodine. She rests here while the market operates.

Pazrodine senses when theft occurs in Seelie Market. She makes her way to the perpetrators and neutralizes the situation nonviolently, usually by using her Dream Breath. Once troublemakers come to, Pazrodine politely but firmly asks them to leave the market. Those who object are flown out in her clutches.

If anyone comes to visit Pazrodine at her refuge, she greets them and happily answers their questions about the market. The dragon has a soothing voice and demeanor.
