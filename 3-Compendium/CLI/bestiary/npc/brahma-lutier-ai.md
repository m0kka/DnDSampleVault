# [Brahma Lutier](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\npc/brahma-lutier-ai.md)
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 205*  

Formally a former member of the "B" Team, Brahma Lutier is a gifted cartographer, spy, and troubadour. Tutored in at least the latter of those vocations by Audra Courtier (wife of Propha Dran and co-owner of the Dran & Courtier inn of Red Larch), Brahma's specialty is a song of domination that is legendarily difficult to resist.

Her retirement is said to be connected to a falling out with husband Oak Truestrike, and Brahma has been operating as a solo agent for some time now. Known for a personality that is murderous and cheery in equal part, she utilizes an instrument of dragonborn design in combat. Known as a war lute, this unique item comes replete with hidden storage and powerful weaponry.
