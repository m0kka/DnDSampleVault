# [Euryale](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\npc/euryale-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 189*  

When she retired from adventuring, Euryale relocated to Cair Ophidian, a small hideaway in the Outlands detailed later in chapter 22. There, Euryale embraced the quiet life of a gardener, and she spends her time tending to the plants she's cultivated around her home. However, should Asteria call for her aid, Euryale would venture across the multiverse without hesitation, battling tooth and nail to protect her sister.

Euryale has the petrifying gaze and venomous snaky hair of other medusas. But as an ancient and powerful druid, Euryale often adopts the form of a hulking serpent when threatened. She has attained precise control over her petrifying gaze, rendering her immune to its effects and allowing her to use it while not in her medusa guise. Despite her alarming appearance in serpent form, Euryale remains a healer and caretaker at heart.
