# [Tsucora Quori](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\aberration/tsucora-quori-erlw.md)
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 307*  

Tsucora quori are nightmarish creatures. Their headless torsos are covered with eyes and twitching limbs, including two massive arms that end in powerful pincers, and a serpentine tail tipped with a vicious stinger. They are cruel and calculating, enjoying the power they wield over others as they concoct elaborate schemes to advance their own positions and discredit their rivals.

## Relentless Schemers

Constantly jockeying for position, each tsucora hopes to be reincarnated as a more powerful servant of the Dreaming Dark. As such, their plans are as often focused on the ruination of competitors as they are on the furthering of il-Lashtavar's plans. When they aren't serving in the cities of their nightmare realm, they hunt the dreaming spirits of mortals.

## Fearmongers

Their ability to manipulate the fears of mortals sees tsucoras often sent to Eberron as Inspired. Nothing keeps humanoid chattel in line like fear, and the tsucoras are the masters of manipulating the uncertainty of mobs and high-ranking officials alike. The effectiveness of tsucora Inspired keeps the members of this order in the good graces of the kalaraq quori.

Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmaresâ€”the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.
