# [Gargantua](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\aberration/gargantua-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 149*  

From time to time—perhaps once a generation, under a particular configuration of stars and planets, or at the whim of some malicious god—a gargantua is born to giant parents. Though the child appears like any other of its kind, the creature's true nature manifests upon reaching adulthood: its complexion turns purplish and horns sprout from its head. The gargantua grows rapidly, eventually towering over other giants at a height of 40 feet or more.

Most gargantuas do not feel at home in giant communities and end up searching for homes large enough to hold their enormous frames. They might find a suitable home in an ancient forest, a deep canyon, or an immense cavern in the Underdark. Some gargantuas seek only peace and solitude, while others lash out fiercely at a world that fears them.

Giants tell a variety of stories to explain the existence of gargantuas. One tale connects their origin to an ancient enclave's pact with an entity from the Far Realm. Another claims that Karontor, "the banished son" of Annam, creates gargantuas in retaliation for his imprisonment. A third blames Annam, claiming the All-Father of the giants is disgusted with his descendants and seeks to destroy them.
