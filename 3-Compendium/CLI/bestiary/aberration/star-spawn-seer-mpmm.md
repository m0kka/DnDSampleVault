# [Star Spawn Seer](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\aberration/star-spawn-seer-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 230, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 236, The Book of Many Things*  

A star spawn seer is most often encountered as the leader of a cult dedicated to one or more Elder Evils. Usually, the seer is the only cult member that grasps the full extent of the horror the cult is venerating. The seer's goal is to tap into vast energy sources and perform the dire rites that will extend a bridge between the Material Plane and the squirming chaos of an Elder Evil's realm.

An entity that appears as a star spawn seer in the Material Plane usually arrives disembodied. When a warlock or other spellcaster establishes communication with it, the seer-entity takes control of the mortal, transforming it into a star spawn seer. Whoever the mortal once was largely vanishes beneath the mass of tumorous skin than builds up in strange whorls all over the seer's body. The mortal's hands become bulky, flipper-like appendages able to grasp the seer's strange staff formed of a blend of flesh, bone, and star stuff.

A star spawn seer is almost always accompanied by one or more star spawn hulks (also in this book). Not only is a hulk a powerful combatant, but when a seer deals psychic damage to a hulk, the hulk isn't hurt, and the effect ricochets off and expands to assault other creatures.

## Star Spawn

The Material Plane represents only one small part of the multiverse. Beyond the best-known planes of existence lie realms alien to mortal life. Some are so hostile that even a moment's contact is enough to break a mortal's mind. Yet beings do exist that are native to these realms: entities that are ever hungering, searching, warring, and sometimes dreaming. These Elder Evils are far older than most of the mortal peoples and always inimical to such creatures' minds.

However much they might desire to enter and dominate the Material Plane, the Elder Evils are unable or unwilling to leave their realms. Some are imprisoned in their dimensions by external forces, some are inextricably bound to their home realities, and others simply can't find any way out.

The creatures known as star spawn are the heralds, servants, and soldiers of the Elder Evils, capable of taking on forms that can journey to the Material Plane. They arrive most often in the wake of a cometâ€”or perhaps this phenomenon merely signals that star spawn are in the vicinity and available for communication. When the signs are right, cultists gather together, read aloud their blasphemous texts, and conduct the mind-searing rituals that guide star spawn into the world.

### Elder Evil Blessings

Disciples of certain Elder Evils can bestow supernatural gifts on those who serve that cult, including star spawn. The following powers are unique to specific cults; typically a creature has only one.

- Cult of Atropus, the World Born Dead  
- Cult of Borem, of the Lake of Boiling Mud  
- Cult of Haask, the Voice of Hargut  
- Cult of Tharizdun, the Chained God  
- Cult of Tyranthraxus, the Flamed One
