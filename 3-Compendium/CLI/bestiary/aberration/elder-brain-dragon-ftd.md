# [Elder Brain Dragon](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\aberration/elder-brain-dragon-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 194*  

One of the few consolations available to those who must contend with a mind flayer colony is the limit of its reach, which spreads only as far as the influence of the colony's elder brain. But this small solace withers away when a colony manages to capture a dragon. Teams of mind flayers bind the dragon, which is subject to a gruesome transformation as the elder brain latches onto the dragon's back and digs its tentacles into the dragon's brain. An elder brain dragon is the nightmarish result.

Using the mobility of the dragon's body, the elder brain can now serve as a powerful general to illithid armies, free from the confines of its brine pool. The elder brain dragon becomes a psychic threat in addition to a physical one, its body rife with aberrant influence and pulsing with psionic power. Even the elder brain dragon's breath weapon mutates during its transformation, becoming a stream of briny liquid roiling with illithid tadpoles. These tadpoles can swiftly slay victims and transform them into mind flayers, allowing the elder brain dragon to grow its own roving colony.

    \ a Humanoid is reduced to 0 hit points while infested, the creature is stable\
    \ but remains unconscious for 6d12 hours. When the period of unconsciousness ends,\
    \ the creature transforms into a [mind flayer](/3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md)\
    \ (see the Monster Manual) with all its hit points. Casting a wish spell on the\
    \ unconscious creature rids it of the infestation and prevents it from turning\
