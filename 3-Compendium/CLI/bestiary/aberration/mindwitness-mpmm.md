# [Mindwitness](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\aberration/mindwitness-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 181, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 176*  

If a beholder is stunned and brought to the brine pool of an elder brain, the beholder can be converted into a mindwitness. This alters some of its eye rays and transforms four of its eyestalks into tentacles similar to a mind flayer's. The mindwitness is psychically imprinted with devotion to the elder brain and submission to illithid commands.

A mindwitness's primary function is to improve telepathic communication in a mind flayer colony. A creature in telepathic communication with a mindwitness can converse through it to as many as seven other creatures the mindwitness can see, rapidly disseminating commands and other information.

If separated from its illithid masters, a mindwitness seeks out other telepathic creatures to tell it what to do. Mindwitnesses have been known to ally with [flumphs](flumph.md) and planar beings such as demons, shifting their worldview and alignment to match those of their new masters.

- "desc": "The mindwitness shoots one magical eye ray at random (roll a d6, and reroll\

    \ must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed\
    \ is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and\
    \ it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both. The\
    \ creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\
    \ the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 5 Stunning Ray. The targeted creature\
    \ must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute.\
    \ The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\
    \ the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 6 Telekinetic Ray. If the target\
    \ is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save,\
    \ the mindwitness moves it up to 30 feet in any direction, and it is restrained\
    \ by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the mindwitness's next turn\
    \ or until the mindwitness is incapacitated.  \n\n    If the target is an object\
    \ weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is telekinetically\
    \ moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The mindwitness can also exert fine control\
    \ on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door\
    \ or a container.  "
