    \ Constitution saving throw or be infected with a diseaseâ€”a minuscule slaad egg.\n\
    \nA humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months,\
    \ the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a [slaad tadpole](/3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole-xphb.md).\
    \ In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its\
    \ speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and\
    \ saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and\
    \ out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.\n\nIf the\
    \ disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated."
