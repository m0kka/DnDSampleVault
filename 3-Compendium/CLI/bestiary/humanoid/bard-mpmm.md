# [Bard](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/bard-mpmm.md)

Bards are gifted poets, storytellers, and entertainers who travel far and wide. They're commonly found in taverns or in the company of jolly bands of adventurers, rough-and-tumble mercenaries, and wealthy patrons.

Each bard is a master of at least one type of performance. You may choose a bard's main type, or you may roll on the Bard Performance Types table to determine it.
