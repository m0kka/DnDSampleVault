# [Solar Bastion Knight](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/solar-bastion-knight-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 75*  

Knights of the Solar Bastion are battle-hardened veterans who operate independently across the multiverse. When word reaches the organization that a Deck of Many Things has appeared, the nearest knight investigates, but every knight has the magical means to contact the Solar Bastion's headquarters and request help. Even so, it's rare for knights to work together outside their headquarters.

The Solar Bastion knight presented here is an example member of the organization.

Customize this stat block to suit individual knights and differentiate them from each other. For example, knights who track the Grim Harrow through the multiverse might resemble rangers instead of paladins.

In addition, Sir Jared, detailed at the end of chapter 10, can serve as a model for knights with a lower challenge rating.
