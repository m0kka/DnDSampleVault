# [Scorchbringer Guard](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/scorchbringer-guard-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 243*  

While chemisters focus on inventing new tools, weapons, and other devices for the guild to use, the role of a blastseeker is to put those devices to work. Despite the name, not all such devices produce explosions, but all the most interesting ones (from the Izzet perspective) do.
