# [War Priest](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/war-priest-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 254, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 218*  

War priests worship deities of war, protection, and strategy. They plan tactics, lead soldiers into battle, confront enemy spellcasters, and tend to casualties. A war priest might command an army or serve as the right hand of a [warlord](warlord-mpmm.md) (appears in "this book") on the battlefield.

War priests typically adorn themselves with a symbol of their faith. You can roll on the War Priest Holy Symbols table below, or choose one that fits your campaign.
