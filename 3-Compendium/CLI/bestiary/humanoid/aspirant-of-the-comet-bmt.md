# [Aspirant of the Comet](3-Compendium\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/aspirant-of-the-comet-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 91*  

Aspirants aren't yet initiated into the mysteries of the Heralds of the Comet, but they are firmly in the group's clutches, both socially and metaphysically. If an aspirant is killed, the hapless individual is drawn into the Void and devoured, body and soul.
