    \ + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage while enlarged. If the\
    \ minotaur moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before\

    \ damage if the minotaur is enlarged. If the target is a creature, it must succeed\
    \ on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet from the minotaur\

    \ it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the minotaur is Large, doubles its\
    \ damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and\

    \ lacks the room to become Large, the minotaur doesn't change size."

    \ see. For the next hour, the minotaur knows the current distance and direction\
    \ to the target if it is on the same plane of existence. The link ends if the\
    \ minotaur has the incapacitated condition or uses this ability on a different\
    \ target."
