# Ring of Evasion
*Rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Ring of Evasion.webp#right)  


This ring has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing the ring, you can take a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) to expend 1 charge to succeed on that save instead.
