# Gem of Brightness
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Gem of Brightness.webp#right)  


This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action and use one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

- **First Command Word.** The gem sheds [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.  
- **Second Command Word.** You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Third Command Word.** You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot [Cone [Area of Effect]](cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in the [Cone [Area of Effect]](cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.  

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.
