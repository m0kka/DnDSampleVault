# Baba Yaga's Dancing Broom
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Baba Yagas Dancing Broom.webp#right)  


The archfey "Baba Yaga" crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to transform it into an [Animated Broom](animated-broom-xmm.md) under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md) count and remains animate until you take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) and use a command word to render it inanimate.

On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don't have the [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the broom is reduced to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md), it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its inanimate form before losing all its [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) it regains all of them.
