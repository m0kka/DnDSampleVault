# Longbow of the Healing Hearth
*Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Range**: 150/600
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This ivory longbow is inscribed with a prayer to the god Hiatea, the runes of which are entwined with gilded engravings of wheat stalks and deer antlers.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one magic arrow when you pull back the string. The arrow created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

The bow has 8 charges for the following properties, which you can use while wielding the bow. The bow regains `1d4 + 1` charges daily at dawn.

## Curative Arrow

When you take the Attack action using the bow, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your attacks with a blazing arrow of curative magic, which automatically hits one creature you can see within 150 feet of you. The target can then immediately spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

If the target has no unspent Hit Dice remaining, nothing happens. You can use a curative arrow only once per turn.

## Spellcasting

While holding the bow, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 18): create food and water (1 charge), warding bond (2 charges), guardian of faith (3 charges).
