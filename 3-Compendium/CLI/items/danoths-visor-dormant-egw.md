# Danoth's Visor (Dormant)
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](items/EGW/Danoth's Visor.webp#right)  


These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot invisible enemies and scout areas from afar.

## Dormant

While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
