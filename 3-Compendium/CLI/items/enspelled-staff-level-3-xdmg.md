Bound into this staff is a level 3 spell. The spell is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains `1d6` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff 's last charge, roll ``. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [Quarterstaff](quarterstaff-xphb.md).

The spell's saving throw DC is 15, and its attack bonus is `+7`.
