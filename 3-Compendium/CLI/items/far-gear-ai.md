# Far Gear
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Charisma saving throws, and you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

## Aberrant Ally

You can conjure an aberrant creature from the chaos of the multiverse to serve you. This functions as the conjure celestial spell (no concentration required), except the creature you summon is an aberration of challenge rating 4 or lower. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

## Unnatural Bane

You can cast the bane spell (save DC 15), which affects any number of creatures within range for 1 minute. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

## Part of a Whole

While this component is not installed in the [Orrery of the Wanderer](orrery-of-the-wanderer-ai.md), its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
