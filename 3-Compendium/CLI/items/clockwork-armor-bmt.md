# Clockwork Armor
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  


The outside surface and internal joints of this armor whir with interlocking gears, drawing on the orderly magic of the plane of Mechanus.

The armor has 4 charges. If you make a `d20` roll while wearing this armor, you can expend 1 charge to change the number rolled to a 10. The armor regains `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn.
