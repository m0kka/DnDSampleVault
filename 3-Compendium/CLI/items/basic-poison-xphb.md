# Basic Poison
*Adventuring gear, poison*  

- **Properties**: [Poison](item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 100 gp

As a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), you can use a vial of Basic Poison to coat one weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from the poisoned weapon or ammunition takes an extra `1d4` Poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute or until its damage is dealt, whichever comes first.
