# Bomb
*Explosive*  

- **Cost**: 100 gp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

As an action, you can light a Bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere [Area of Effect]](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on that point makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d6` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
