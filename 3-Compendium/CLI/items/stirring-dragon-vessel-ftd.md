# Stirring Dragon Vessel
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  


This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, mead, a potion of healing, a potion of greater healing, a potion of climbing, or a potion of fire breath. Once this property is used, it can't be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn't imbibed within 24 hours.
