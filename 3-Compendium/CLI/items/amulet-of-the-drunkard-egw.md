# Amulet of the Drunkard
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/EGW/Amulet of the Drunkard.webp#right)  


This amulet smells of old, ale-stained wood. While wearing it, you can regain `4d4 + 4` hit points when you drink a pint of beer, ale, mead, or wine. Once the amulet has restored hit points, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
