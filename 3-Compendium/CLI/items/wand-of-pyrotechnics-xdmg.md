# Wand of Pyrotechnics
*Common*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and create a harmless burst of multicolored light at a point you can see up to 120 feet away. The burst of light is accompanied by a crackling noise that can be heard up to 300 feet away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts only a second.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll ``. On a 1, the wand erupts in a harmless pyrotechnic display and is destroyed.
