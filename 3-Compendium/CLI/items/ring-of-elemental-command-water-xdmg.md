# Ring of Elemental Command (Water)
*Legendary (requires attunement)*  


The Ring of Elemental Command (water) is linked to the Elemental Plane of Water. Every Ring of Elemental Command has the following two properties:

- **Elemental Bane.** While wearing the ring, you have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against Elementals and they have [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against you.  
- **Elemental Compulsion.** While wearing the ring, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.  

## Elemental Focus

While wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring's linked Elemental Plane:

- **Water.** You know Aquan, you gain a [Swim Speed](swim-speed-xphb.md) of 60 feet, and you can breathe underwater.  

## Spellcasting

The ring has 5 charges and regains `1d4 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. A spell cast from the ring has a save DC of 18. Choose the spell from the following list: [Create or Destroy Water](create-or-destroy-water-xphb.md) (1 charge), [Ice Storm](ice-storm-xphb.md) (2 charges), [Tsunami](tsunami-xphb.md) (5 charges), [Wall of Ice](wall-of-ice-xphb.md) (3 charges), [Water Walk](water-walk-xphb.md) (2 charges)
