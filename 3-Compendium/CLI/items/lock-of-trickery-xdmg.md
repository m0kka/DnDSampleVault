# Lock of Trickery
*Wondrous item, common*  


This lock appears to be an ordinary [Lock](lock-xphb.md) (of the type described in chapter 6 of the "Player's Handbook") and comes with a single key. The tumblers in this lock magically adjust to thwart burglars. Dexterity checks made to pick the lock have [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md).
