Crafted from a single piece of obsidian, this warhammer of Torog hums with magical energy and is carved with the images of faces screaming in pain.

## Sentience

Grovelthrash is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Infernal.

## Personality

A covetous [ultroloth](ultroloth.md) named Ciria lives within Grovelthrash. The weapon values material possessions and doling out pain. It compliments its wielder whenever they claim treasure and takes pleasure in harming others.

## Dormant

The warhammer grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal.

- While holding this weapon, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to discern a lie spoken in a language you understand.
