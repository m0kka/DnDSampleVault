# Shield of Missile Attraction
*Armor (shield), cursed item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Shield of Missile Attraction.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [Cursed](item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this Shield, you have [Resistance](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.

## Curse

This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a [Remove Curse](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/remove-curse-xphb.md) spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
