# Robe of Stars
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Robe of Stars.webp#right)  


This black or dark-blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe's upper-front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to remove one of the stars and expend it to cast the level 5 version of [Magic Missile](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/magic-missile-xphb.md). Daily at dusk, `1d6` removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.
