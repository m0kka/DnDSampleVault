# Amulet of the Planes
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Amulet of the Planes.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this amulet, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a successful check, you cast [Plane Shift](plane-shift-xphb.md). On a failed check, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination determined by rolling `1d100` and consulting the following table.

`dice: [](amulet-of-the-planes-xdmg.md#^1-destination)`
