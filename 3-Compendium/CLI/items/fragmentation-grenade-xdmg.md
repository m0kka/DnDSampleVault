# Fragmentation Grenade
*Explosive*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

As an action, you can either throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away or use a Grenade Launcher to propel the grenade to a point up to 1,000 feet away. The grenade explodes at that point, creating a particular effect in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere [Area of Effect]](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md).

Each creature in the [Sphere [Area of Effect]](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
