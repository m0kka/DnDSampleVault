# Jester Card
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](decks/BMT/Deck of Many Things/14-jester.webp#right)  


As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the Otto's Irresistible Dance spell (save DC 17), and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
