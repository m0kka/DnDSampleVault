# Ring of Invisibility
*Legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Ring of Invisibility.webp#right)  


While wearing this ring, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to give yourself the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition. You remain [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) until the ring is removed or until you take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to become visible again.
