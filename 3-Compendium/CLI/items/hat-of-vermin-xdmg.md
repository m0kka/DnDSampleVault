# Hat of Vermin
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](items/XDMG/Hat of Vermin.webp#right)  


This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a [Bat](bat-xphb.md), a [Frog](frog-xphb.md), or a [Rat](rat-xphb.md). The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is [Indifferent [Attitude]](indifferent-attitude-xphb.md) toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
