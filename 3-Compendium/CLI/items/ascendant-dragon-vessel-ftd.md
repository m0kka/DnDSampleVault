# Ascendant Dragon Vessel
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  


This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, mead, wine, whiskey, a potion of healing, a potion of greater healing, a potion of superior healing, a potion of supreme healing, a potion of climbing, a potion of fire breath, a potion of flying, or a [potion of dragon's majesty](potion-of-dragons-majesty-ftd.md). Once this property is used, it can't be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn't imbibed within 24 hours.
