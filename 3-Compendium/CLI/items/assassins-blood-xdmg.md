# Assassin's Blood

A creature subjected to Assassin's Blood makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (`1d12`) Poison damage and has the [Poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
