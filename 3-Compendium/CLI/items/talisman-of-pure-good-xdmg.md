# Talisman of Pure Good
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A Fiend or an Undead that touches the talisman takes `8d6` Radiant damage and takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

## Holy Symbol

You can use the talisman as a Holy Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

## Pure Rebuke

The talisman has 7 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Fiend or an Undead, it has [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes `4d6` Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.
