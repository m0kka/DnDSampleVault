# Staff of Birdcalls
*Staff, weapon, common*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This wooden staff is decorated with bird carvings. It has 10 charges. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause it to create one of the following sounds, which can be heard out to 120 feet: a finch's chirp, a raven's caw, a duck's quack, a chicken's cluck, a goose's honk, a loon's call, a turkey's gobble, a seagull's cry, an owl's hoot, or an eagle's shriek.

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll ``. On a 1, the staff explodes in a harmless cloud of bird feathers and is lost forever.
