# Pole of Collapsing
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](items/XDMG/Pole of Collapsing.webp#right)  


This item functions as a Pole. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to collapse it into a 1-foot-long rod for ease of storage (the pole's weight doesn't change) or cause the 1-foot-long rod to revert to a Pole. The rod elongates only as far as the surrounding space allows.
