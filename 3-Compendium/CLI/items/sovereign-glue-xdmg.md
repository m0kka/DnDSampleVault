# Sovereign Glue
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](items/XDMG/Sovereign Glue.webp#right)  


This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [Oil of Slipperiness](oil-of-slipperiness-xdmg.md). When found, a container contains `1d6 + 1` ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes a [Utilize](actions.md#Utilize) action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of Universal Solvent or [Oil of Etherealness](oil-of-etherealness-xdmg.md), or with a [Wish](wish-xphb.md) spell.
