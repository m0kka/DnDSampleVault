# Knight Card
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](decks/BMT/Deck of Many Things/09-knight.webp#right)  


As an action, you can throw this card to an unoccupied space on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the card magically transforms into a [deck defender](deck-defender-bmt.md) (see "chapter 9" for its stat block) for up to 1 minute or until you use an action to speak the command word again, whereupon it transforms back into a card. The deck defender obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, it takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. The deck defender reverts to a card early if it drops to 0 hit points. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
