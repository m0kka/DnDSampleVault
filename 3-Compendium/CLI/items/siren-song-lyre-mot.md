# Siren Song Lyre
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  


You can use an action to play this lyre and cast one of the following spells from it: animal friendship, charm person, enthrall, suggestion. If the spell requires a saving throw, the spell save DC is 13.

Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
