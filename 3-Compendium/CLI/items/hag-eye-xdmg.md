# Hag Eye
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Hag Eye.webp#right)  


A Hag Eye has 3 charges. While wearing or holding this item, you can expend 1 charge to cast [Darkvision](darkvision-xphb.md) (targeting yourself only) or [See Invisibility](see-invisibility-xphb.md). The Hag Eye regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

## Coven Sensor

The Hag Eye is usually entrusted to a hag's minion for safekeeping and transport. As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, a hag who belongs to the coven that created the Hag Eye can see what the Hag Eye sees if the hag and the Hag Eye are on the same plane of existence. This effect lasts as long as the hag maintains [Concentration](conditions.md#Concentration). Multiple hags in the coven can see through the Hag Eye simultaneously.

## Creating a Hag Eye

Only a hag coven can craft this item, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or another wearable item. A hag coven can have only one Hag Eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a special rite. This rite takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it if one or more of them has the [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. If the hags take any other actions during this rite, the rite fails and ends.
