# Crystal Ball of Mind Reading
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [Scrying](scrying-xphb.md) (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can cast [Detect Thoughts](detect-thoughts-xphb.md) (save DC 17) targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [Detect Thoughts](detect-thoughts-xphb.md) spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if the [Scrying](scrying-xphb.md) spell ends.
