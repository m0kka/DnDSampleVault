# Breastplate of Balance
*Rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 14
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

This burnished copper breastplate looks as if it were made of interlocking gears. Merchant's scales are emblazoned across the chest.

The armor has 4 charges. You can use the charges in the following ways while wearing the armor:

- **Equalize.** When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a `d20` with advantage or disadvantage, you can expend 1 charge and take a reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.  
- **Expunge Imbalance.** As a bonus action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the Lesser Restoration spell from the armor.  

The armor regains `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn.

This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.
