# Comet Card
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](decks/BMT/Deck of Many Things/12-comet.webp#right)  


As an action, you can hold this card aloft and call down a fiery meteor to a point you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `6d6` bludgeoning damage and `6d6` fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
