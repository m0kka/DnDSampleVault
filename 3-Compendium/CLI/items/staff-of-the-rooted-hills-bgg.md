# Staff of the Rooted Hills
*Staff, weapon, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

The hill rune is carved into this gnarled wooden staff. The staff magically resizes to match the height of any creature that attunes to it.

The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The first time you hit any creature with the staff on your turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be restrained by spectral vines until the start of your next turn.

## Invoking the Rune

As an action, you can invoke the staff's rune to cast either hold person (save DC 12) or speak with plants with the staff. When you cast hold person using the staff, the target is wreathed in spectral vines.

Once the rune has been invoked to cast either spell, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.
