# Wand of Fireballs
*Rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](items/XDMG/Wand of Fireballs.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast [Fireball](fireball-xphb.md) (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 3 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll ``. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
