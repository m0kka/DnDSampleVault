`dice: [](khyber-trinket-erlw.md#^trinkets-from-khyber)`

| dice: d10 | Trinket |
|-----------|---------|
| 1 | A pressed flower with vivid green petals; when you smell it, you hear eerie music |
| 2 | A tiny ball of putty; if you set it down, it begins to slowly crawl around |
| 3 | A perpetually warm disk of dark iron |
| 4 | A small journal with leathery pages; any words you write in it slowly disappear |
| 5 | A four-sided die carved with strange markings |
| 6 | A cameo with the silhouette of an unknown species |
| 7 | A preserved finger with purple flesh and four joints |
| 8 | A perfectly preserved eye; if you set it down, it rotates to follow your movement |
| 9 | A small box; when opened, you alone hear screaming |
| 10 | A preserved insect; you've never seen another like it |
