# Puzzle Card
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](decks/BMT/Deck of Many Things/04-puzzle.webp#right)  


As an action, you can hold this card aloft and magically disable each trap within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover. A trap, for the purpose of this property, includes any object or mechanism that would inflict a sudden effect that was intended by its maker to cause harm or inconvenience. If the trap is the effect of a spell, such as Alarm, that trap is suppressed for 10 minutes instead of being disabled. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
