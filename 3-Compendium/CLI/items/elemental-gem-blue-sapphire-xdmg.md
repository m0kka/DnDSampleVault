# Elemental Gem, Blue Sapphire
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Elemental Gem (Blue Sapphire).webp#right)  


This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you take a [Utilize](actions.md#Utilize) action to break the gem, an [Air Elemental](air-elemental-xmm.md) is summoned, and the gem ceases to be magical. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the broken gem as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md) count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md).
