# Pot of Awakening
*Wondrous item, common*  


If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an [Awakened Shrub](awakened-shrub-xmm.md) at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.

The awakened shrub is [Friendly [Attitude]](friendly-attitude-xphb.md) toward you and obeys your commands. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.
