# Hat of Wizardry
*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](items/XDMG/Hat of Wizardry.webp#right)  


This cone-shaped hat is adorned with moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

## Spellcasting Focus

You can use the hat as a [Spellcasting Focus](spellcasting-focus-xphb.md) for your Wizard spells.

## Unknown Spell

As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).
