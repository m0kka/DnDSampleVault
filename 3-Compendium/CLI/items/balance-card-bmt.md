# Balance Card
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](decks/BMT/Deck of Many Things/03-balance.webp#right)  


As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and drain its life force. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take `4d8` necrotic damage. You then regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage the target takes. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."
