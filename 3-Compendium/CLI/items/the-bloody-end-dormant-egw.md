# The Bloody End (Dormant)
*Weapon (morningstar), artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

Carrying the power of Bane, this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.

## Sentience

The Bloody End is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.

## Personality

A tyrannical [pit fiend](pit-fiend.md) named Izeelzee lives within The Bloody End. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.

## Dormant

The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Infernal.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
- While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 13): charm person, dominate person, or fear. Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.  
- While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.  

> [!note] Betrayer Artifact Properties
> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.
