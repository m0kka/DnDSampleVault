# Fate Cutter Shears
*Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

The blades of these pruning shears bear many nicks and dents but still cut cleanly. The shears function as a magic dagger. The weapon has the following properties:

- **Ever Sharp.** When you hit with an attack using the shears, the target takes an extra `1d6` force damage.  
- **Sever Threads.** When you hit a creature with the shears, you can cut that creature's fate. Until the target finishes a long rest, attack rolls against it score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the `d20`. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
