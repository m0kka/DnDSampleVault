# Goose Egg Trinket


Sometimes, an egg laid by a [giant goose](giant-goose-bgg.md) inexplicably contains some kind of small trinket or minor magic item. Once it lays a golden egg, a giant goose can't do so again for a year and a day.

You can use the Goose Egg Trinket table to determine the contents of a golden egg. A giant goose's egg can be a great way to give characters an item that's important to the story of an adventure or your campaign.
