# Khrusor, Spear of Heliod
*Weapon (spear), artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](items/MOT/Khrusor, Spear of Heliod.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 P
  - Two-handed: 1d8 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

Heliod wields Khrusor, a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it's typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.

## Spear of the Sun

This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra `2d8` radiant damage.

## Blessing of the Sun

If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

- **Piety 3+.** You gain 15 temporary hit points each dawn.  
- **Piety 10+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.  
- **Piety 25+.** The spear has 1 additional randomly determined minor beneficial property.  
- **Piety 50+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.  

If you aren't a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.

## Luminous

The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.

## Sun's Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Spells

The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: guiding bolt (1 charge), daylight (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), sunbeam (6 charges). The spear regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn.

## Destroying the Spear

If taken to Erebos's palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos's service.
