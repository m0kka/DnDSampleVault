# Staff of Flowers
*Staff, weapon, common*  
![](items/XDMG/Staff of Flowers.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of yourself, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll ``. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.
