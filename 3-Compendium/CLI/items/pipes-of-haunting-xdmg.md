# Pipes of Haunting
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Pipes of Haunting.webp#right)  


These pipes have 3 charges and regain `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours.
