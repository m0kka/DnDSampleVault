# Gunpowder (keg)
*Explosive*  

- **Cost**: 250 gp
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

Setting fire to a keg full of Gunpowder causes it to explode. When a keg explodes, each creature in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere [Area of Effect]](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on the keg makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 (`7d6`) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
