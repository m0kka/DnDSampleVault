# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](items/XDMG/Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals.webp#right)  


While you are within 5 feet of this brazier, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to summon a [Fire Elemental](fire-elemental-xmm.md). The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the brazier as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md) count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md). The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
