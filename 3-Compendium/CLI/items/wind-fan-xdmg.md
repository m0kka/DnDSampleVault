# Wind Fan
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Wind Fan.webp#right)  


While holding this fan, you can cast [Gust of Wind](gust-of-wind-xphb.md) (save DC 13) from it. Each subsequent time the fan is used before the next dawn, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working; if the fan fails to work, it tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.
