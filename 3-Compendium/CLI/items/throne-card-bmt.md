# Throne Card
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](decks/BMT/Deck of Many Things/15-throne.webp#right)  


As an action, you can speak a command word while holding this card to gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) checks for 1 minute. In addition, for that duration, you can use this card to cast the Command spell (save DC 17) as an action. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
