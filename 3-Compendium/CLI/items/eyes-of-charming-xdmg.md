# Eyes of Charming
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Eyes of Charming.webp#right)  


These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more charges to cast [Charm Person](charm-person-xphb.md) (save DC 13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You increase the spell's level by one for each additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
