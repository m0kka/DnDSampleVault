# Prosthetic Limb
*Wondrous item, common*  


This magic item replaces a lost limbâ€”a hand, an arm, a foot, a leg, or a similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. You can detach or reattach it as a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, and it can't be removed against your will while you are alive.
