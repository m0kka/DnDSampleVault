# Black Sap

- **Cost**: 300 gp

This tarry substance harvested from the dark boughs of the death's head willow is a powerful intoxicant. It can be smoked as a concentrate or injected directly into the bloodstream. A creature subjected to a dose of black sap cannot be charmed or frightened for `1d6` hours.

For each dose of black sap consumed, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for `2d4` hoursâ€”an effect that is cumulative with multiple doses.
