# Zephyr Armor
*Rare (requires attunement)*  


This fine set of white-and-silver armor bears the wind rune upon its chest.

While wearing this armor, you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws as your movements are bolstered by gentle currents of wind.

## Invoking the Rune
