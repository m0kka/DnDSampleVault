# Cloak of Invisibility
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  


This cloak has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the cloak, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to pull its hood over your head and expend 1 charge to give yourself the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition for 1 hour. The effect ends early if you pull the hood down (no action required) or cease wearing the hood.
