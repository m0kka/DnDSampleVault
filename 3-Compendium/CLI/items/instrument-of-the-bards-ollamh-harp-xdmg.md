# Instrument of the Bards, Ollamh Harp
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](items/XDMG/Ollamh Harp.webp#right)  


An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the Ollamh Harp to cast one of the following spells: [Fly](fly-xphb.md), [Invisibility](invisibility-xphb.md), [Levitate](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/levitate-xphb.md), [Protection from Evil and Good](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Confusion](confusion-xphb.md), [Control Weather](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/control-weather-xphb.md), and [Fire Storm](fire-storm-xphb.md). Once the Ollamh Harp has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
