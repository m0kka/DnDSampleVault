# Smoke Grenade
*Explosive*  

- **Cost**: 50 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

As an action, you can either throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away or use a Grenade Launcher to propel the grenade to a point up to 1,000 feet away. The grenade explodes at that point, creating a particular effect in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere [Area of Effect]](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md).

The area of the [Sphere [Area of Effect]](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Heavily Obscured](heavily-obscured-xphb.md) by smoke for 1 minute. A strong wind (such as the [Gust of Wind](gust-of-wind-xphb.md) spell) disperses the smoke.
