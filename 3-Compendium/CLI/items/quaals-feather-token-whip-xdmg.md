# Quaal's Feather Token, Whip
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](items/XDMG/Quaals Feather Token (Whip).webp#right)  


This object looks like a feather.

You can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes `1d6 + 5` Force damage.

As a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.
