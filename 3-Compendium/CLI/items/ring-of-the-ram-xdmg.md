# Ring of the Ram
*Rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Ring of the Ram.webp#right)  


This ring has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 to 3 charges to make a ranged spell attack against one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes `2d10` Force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to try to break a nonmagical object you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.
