# Potion of Growth
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [Enlarge/Reduce](enlarge-reduce-xphb.md) spell for 10 minutes (no [Concentration](conditions.md#Concentration) required).

The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
