# Helm of Telepathy
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Helm of Telepathy.webp#right)  


While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast [Detect Thoughts](detect-thoughts-xphb.md) or [Suggestion](suggestion-xphb.md) (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
