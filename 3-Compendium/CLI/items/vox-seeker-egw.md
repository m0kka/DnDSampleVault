# Vox Seeker
*Wondrous item, common*  


This clockwork device resembles a metal crab the size of a dinner plate. Every action used to wind up the device allows it to operate for 1 minute, to a maximum of 10 minutes. While operational, the item uses the accompanying [Vox Seeker](3-Compendium/CLI/bestiary/construct/vox-seeker-egw.md) stat block. This automaton is under the DM's control. A vox seeker reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.
