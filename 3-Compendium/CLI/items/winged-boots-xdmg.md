# Winged Boots
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Winged Boots.webp#right)  


These boots have 4 charges and regain `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the boots, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge, gaining a [Fly Speed](fly-speed-xphb.md) of 30 feet for 1 hour. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.
