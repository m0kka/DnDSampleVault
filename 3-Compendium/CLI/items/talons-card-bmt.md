# Talons Card
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](decks/BMT/Deck of Many Things/21-talons.webp#right)  


As an action, you can brandish this card and target one magic item you can see within 120 feet of yourself. If the item isn't an artifact, its magical properties are suppressed for 1 minute. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
