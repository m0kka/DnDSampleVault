# Elemental Essence Shard (Fire)
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use the following property:

## Property

One target of the spell that you can see catches fire. The burning target takes `2d10` fire damage at the start of its next turn, and then the flames go out.
