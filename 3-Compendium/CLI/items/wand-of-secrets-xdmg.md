# Wand of Secrets
*Uncommon*  
![](items/XDMG/Wand of Secrets.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge, and if a secret door or trap is within 60 feet of you, the wand pulses and points at the one nearest to you.
