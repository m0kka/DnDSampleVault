# Shield of the Cavalier
*Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Shield of the Cavalier.webp#right)  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to [Armor Class](armor-class-xphb.md). This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

The Shield has the following additional properties that you can use while holding it.

## Forceful Bash

When you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack), you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your [Proficiency](proficiency-xphb.md) and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to the target equal to `2d6 + 2` plus your Strength modifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock it down, giving it the [Prone](conditions.md#Prone) condition.

## Protective Field

As a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md), when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot [Emanation [Area of Effect]](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from you. When the [Emanation [Area of Effect]](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered the [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) has no effect on creatures and objects inside the [Emanation [Area of Effect]](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md), which lasts as long as you maintain [Concentration](conditions.md#Concentration), up to 1 minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the [Emanation [Area of Effect]](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md). A creature or object inside the [Emanation [Area of Effect]](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the [Emanation [Area of Effect]](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) damage anything outside it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
