# Potion of Fire Breath
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

After drinking this potion, you can take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `4d6` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.

This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.
