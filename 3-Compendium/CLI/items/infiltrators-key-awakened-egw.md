# Infiltrator's Key (Awakened)
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](items/EGW/Infiltrator's Key.webp#right)  


This mithral skeleton key was forged using the blood of twelve master thieves executed for trying to steal magic items during the Age of Arcanum.

## Dormant

The Infiltrator's Key grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- The key can be used as [thieves' tools](thieves-tools-xphb.md) for the purpose of opening locks. When using the key, you are considered proficient in [thieves' tools](thieves-tools-xphb.md) and you have advantage on ability checks made to open locks.  
- While holding the key, your steps are muffled, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move silently.  

## Awakened

When the Infiltrator's Key reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- While holding the key, you can use a bonus action to transform the key into a magic dagger or back into a key. While the key is in the form of a dagger, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.  
- While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: alter self, invisibility, knock, or pass without trace. Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
