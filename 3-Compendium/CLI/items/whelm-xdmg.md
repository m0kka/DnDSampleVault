Whelm is a powerful weapon forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

## Hurl

Whelm has [Thrown](item-properties.md#Thrown) with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack roll using Whelm, the target takes an extra `1d8` Force damage, or an extra `4d8` Force damage if the target is a Construct, an Elemental, or a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.

## Shock Wave

You can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have the [Stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Supernatural Awareness

While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can cast [Detect Evil and Good](detect-evil-and-good-xphb.md) or [Locate Object](locate-object-xphb.md) from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.

## Sentience

Whelm is a sentient, Lawful Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision) out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin.

## Personality

Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. Whelm's purpose is to protect dwarves. Conflict arises if the wielder doesn't share this goal.

## Destroying Whelm

Whelm can be dissolved in the acidic bile of a recently slain [ancient black dragon](ancient-black-dragon-xmm.md). It can also be melted down in the forges of the Mightyhammer dwarf clan, but only by the rightful leader of that clan.
