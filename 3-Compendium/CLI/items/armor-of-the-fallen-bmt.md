# Armor of the Fallen
*Uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](items/BMT/Armor of the Fallen.webp#right)  


While wearing this armor, you can use it to cast either Speak with Dead or Animate Dead. Once the armor has cast a spell in this way, it can't cast either spell until the next dawn.

Your soul keeps this armor together. If you die while you are attuned to the armor, the armor is destroyed.
