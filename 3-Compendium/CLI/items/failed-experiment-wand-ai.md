# Failed Experiment Wand
*Rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 2 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast either a green-flamed fireball or a blue lightning bolt at random from it (save DC 15).

For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
