# Ring of Regeneration
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Ring of Regeneration.webp#right)  


While wearing this ring, you regain `1d6` [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) every 10 minutes if you have at least 1 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `1d6 + 1` days if you have at least 1 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) the whole time.
