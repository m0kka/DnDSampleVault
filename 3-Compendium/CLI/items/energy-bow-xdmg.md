# Energy Bow
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  


You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has no string. Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion, a magical arrow made of golden energy appears nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by this weapon deals Force damage instead of Piercing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow emits [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet.

This weapon has the following additional properties.

## Arrow of Restraint

Whenever you use this weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature, you can try to restrain the target instead of dealing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the [Restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) condition for 1 minute. As an action, a creature [Restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) by an arrow can make a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](skills.md#Athletics)) check to try to break the restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful check.

## Arrow of Transport

As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, you can fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot [Cube [Area of Effect]](cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.

## Energy Ladder

As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, you can loose a flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall. This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.
