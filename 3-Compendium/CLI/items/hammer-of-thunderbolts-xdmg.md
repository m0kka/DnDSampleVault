# Hammer of Thunderbolts
*Legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](items/XDMG/Hammer of Thunderbolts.webp#right)  


You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon has 5 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the weapon, hurling it as if it had [Thrown](item-properties.md#Thrown) with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

If the attack hits, the weapon unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [Stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) condition until the end of your next turn. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand. The weapon regains `1d4 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn.

## Giant's Bane

While you are attuned to the weapon and wearing either a [Belt of Giant Strength](belt-of-giant-strength-xdmg.md) or [Gauntlets of Ogre Power](gauntlets-of-ogre-power-xdmg.md) to which you are also attuned, you gain the following benefits:

- **Giants' Bane.** When you roll a 20 on the `d20` for an attack roll made with this weapon against a Giant, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.  
- **Might of Giants.** The Strength score bestowed by your [Belt of Giant Strength](belt-of-giant-strength-xdmg.md) or [Gauntlets of Ogre Power](gauntlets-of-ogre-power-xdmg.md) increases by 4, to a maximum of 30.
