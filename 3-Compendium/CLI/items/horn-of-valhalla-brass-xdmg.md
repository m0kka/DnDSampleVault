# Horn of Valhalla, Brass
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](items/XDMG/Horn of Valhalla.webp#right)  


You can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the [Berserker](berserker-xmm.md) stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [Immunity](immunity-xphb.md) to the [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) and [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A brass horn summons 3 [Berserkers](berserker-xmm.md). To use the brass horn, you must have [Proficiency](proficiency-xphb.md) with all Simple weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [Berserkers](berserker-xmm.md) attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [Friendly [Attitude]](friendly-attitude-xphb.md) to you and your allies and follow your commands.
