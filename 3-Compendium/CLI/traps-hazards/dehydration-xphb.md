# Dehydration
*Generic Hazard*  

A creature requires an amount of water per day based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the required water for a day gains 1 [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) level at the day's end. [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) caused by dehydration can't be removed until the creature drinks the full amount of water required for a day.

**Water Needs per Day**

|------|-------|
| Tiny | 1/4 gallon |
| Small | 1 gallon |
| Medium | 1 gallon |
| Large | 4 gallons |
| Huge | 16 gallons |
| Gargantuan | 64 gallons |
