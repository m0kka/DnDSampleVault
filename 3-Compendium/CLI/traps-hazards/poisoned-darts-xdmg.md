# Poisoned Darts
*Generic Hazard*  

When a creature moves onto this trap's pressure plate for the first time on a turn, poisoned darts shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding walls. The holes that house these tubes are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or skillfully hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes.

Each creature in the darts' path must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by `1d3` darts, taking 3 (`1d6`) Poison damage per dart.

## Detect and Disarm

As a [Search](actions.md#Search) action, a creature can examine the walls and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](skills.md#Perception)) check, detecting the holes on a successful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth, or detritus prevents the darts from firing.

As a [Search](actions.md#Search) action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](skills.md#Perception)) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an [Iron Spike](iron-spikes-xphb.md) or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing each dart's Poison damage as follows: 7 (`2d6`) at levels 5–10, 14 (`4d6`) at levels 11–16, or 24 (`7d6`) at levels 17–20.
