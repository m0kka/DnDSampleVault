# Malnutrition
*Generic Hazard*  

A creature needs an amount of food per day based on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table. A creature that eats but consumes less than half the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution [Saving Throw](saving-throw-xphb.md) or gain 1 [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) level at the day's end. A creature that eats nothing for 5 days automatically gains 1 [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) level at the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level at the end of each subsequent day without food.

[Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) caused by malnutrition can't be removed until the creature eats the full amount of food required for a day.
