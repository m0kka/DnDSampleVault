# Suffocation
*Generic Hazard*  

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins. When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it gains 1 [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) level at the end of each of its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it removes all levels of [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) it gained from suffocating.
