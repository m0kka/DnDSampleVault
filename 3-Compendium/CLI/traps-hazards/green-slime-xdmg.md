# Green Slime
*Generic Hazard*  

Acidic green slime devours flesh, organic material, and metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches.

One patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square. Green slime has [Blindsight](senses.md#Blindsight) with a range of 30 feet, and it drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement below itself. Beyond that, it can't move. A creature aware of the slime's presence can avoid being struck by it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.

A creature that comes in contact with green slime takes 5 (`1d10`) Acid damage. The creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns until the slime is scraped off (requiring an action) or destroyed. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 11 (`2d10`) Acid damage each round, and any nonmagical wood or metal item used to scrape off the green slime is destroyed.

Direct sunlight or any amount of Cold, Fire, or Radiant damage destroys a patch of green slime.
