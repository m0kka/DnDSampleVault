*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156*  

**Prerequisite**: 9th-level Warlock

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra `1d6` Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your [Hit Point Dice](hit-point-dice-xphb.md) to roll it and regain a number of [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md)).
