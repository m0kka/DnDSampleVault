# Gift of the Protectors
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156*  

**Prerequisite**: 9th-level Warlock

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name).

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).

As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, you can erase a name on the page by touching it.
