# One with Shadows
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level Warlock

While you're in an area of [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you can cast [Invisibility](invisibility-xphb.md) on yourself without expending a spell slot.
