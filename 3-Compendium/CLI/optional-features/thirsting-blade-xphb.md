# Thirsting Blade
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 157*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level Warlock

You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact weapon only. With that feature, you can attack twice with the weapon instead of once when you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action on your turn.
