# Pact of the Chain
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 157*  

You learn the [Find Familiar](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md) spell and can cast it as a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [Imp](imp-xphb.md), [Pseudodragon](pseudodragon-xphb.md), [Quasit](quasit-xphb.md), [Skeleton](skeleton-xphb.md), [Slaad Tadpole](slaad-tadpole-xphb.md), [Sphinx of Wonder](sphinx-of-wonder-xphb.md), [Sprite](sprite-xphb.md), or [Venomous Snake](venomous-snake-xphb.md) (see appendix B for the familiar's stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md).
