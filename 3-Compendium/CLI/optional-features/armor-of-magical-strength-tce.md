# Armor of Magical Strength
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 20*  

This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor's charges in the following ways:

- When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.  
- If the creature would be knocked prone, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.  

The armor regains `1d6` expended charges daily at dawn.
