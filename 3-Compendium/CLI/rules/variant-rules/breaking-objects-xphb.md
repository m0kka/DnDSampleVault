# Breaking Objects
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 362. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the DM may allow a creature to break it automatically with the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) or [Utilize](actions.md#Utilize) action.

## Armor Class

The Object [Armor Class](armor-class-xphb.md) table suggests ACs for various substances.

**Object Armor Class**

| AC | Substance |
|----|-----------|
| 11 | Cloth, paper, rope |
| 13 | Crystal, glass, ice |
| 15 | Wood |
| 17 | Stone |
| 19 | Iron, steel |
| 21 | Mithral |
| 23 | Adamantite |

## Hit Points

An object is destroyed when it has 0 Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) separately. The DM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse.

**Object Hit Points**

| Size | Fragile | Resilient |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Tiny (bottle, lock) | 2 (`1d4`) | 5 (`2d4`) |
| Small (chest, lute) | 3 (`1d6`) | 10 (`3d6`) |
| Medium (barrel, chandelier) | 4 (`1d8`) | 18 (`4d8`) |
| Large (cart, dining table) | 5 (`1d10`) | 27 (`5d10`) |

## Damage Types and Objects

Objects have [Immunity](immunity-xphb.md) to Poison and Psychic damage. The DM might decide that some [Damage Types](damage-types-xphb.md) are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have [Vulnerability](vulnerability-xphb.md) to Fire damage.

## Damage Threshold

Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold.

## No Ability Scores

An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can't make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws.
