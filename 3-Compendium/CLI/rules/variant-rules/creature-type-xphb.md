# Creature Type
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

Every creature, including every [Player Character](player-character-xphb.md), has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature it is. Most [Player Character](player-character-xphb.md) are of the Humanoid type. These are the game's creature types:

- Elemental  
- Monstrosity  
- Beast  
- Fey  
- Ooze  
- Celestial  
- Fiend  
- Plant  
- Construct  
- Giant  
- Undead  
- Dragon  
- Humanoid  

The types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways.
