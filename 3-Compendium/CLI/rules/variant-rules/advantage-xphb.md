# Advantage
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 360. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have Advantage on a [D20 Test](d20-test-xphb.md), roll two d20s, and use the higher roll. A roll can't be affected by more than one Advantage, and Advantage and [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on the same roll cancel each other.
