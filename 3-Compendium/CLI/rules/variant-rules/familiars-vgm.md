# Familiars
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 213* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the find familiar spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [cranium rat](cranium-rat-mpmm.md), a [crawling claw](crawling-claw.md), a [gazer](gazer-mpmm.md), an [imp](imp-xphb.md), a [pseudodragon](pseudodragon-xphb.md), or a [quasit](quasit-xphb.md).
