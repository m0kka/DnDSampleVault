*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 374. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Sphere is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin outward in all directions. The effect that creates a Sphere specifies the distance it extends as the radius of the Sphere.

A Sphere's point of origin is included in the Sphere's area of effect.
