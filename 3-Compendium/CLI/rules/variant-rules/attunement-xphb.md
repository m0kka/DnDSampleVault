# Attunement
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond—called Attunement—with them before the creature can use an item's magical properties. A creature can have Attunement with no more than three magic items at a time.
