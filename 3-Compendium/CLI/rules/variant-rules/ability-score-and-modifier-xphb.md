# Ability Score and Modifier
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 360. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—each of which has a corresponding modifier. Add the modifier when you make a [D20 Test](d20-test-xphb.md) Test with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks you to do so.
