# Proficiency
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have proficiency with something, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any [D20 Test](d20-test-xphb.md) you make using that thing. A creature might have proficiency in a skill or [Saving Throw](saving-throw-xphb.md) or with a weapon or tool.
