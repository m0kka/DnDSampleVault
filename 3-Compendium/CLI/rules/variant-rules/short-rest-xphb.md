# Short Rest
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md).

## Benefits of the Rest

When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

- **Spend Hit Point Dice.** You can spend one or more of your [Hit Point Dice](hit-point-dice-xphb.md) to regain [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). For each [Hit Point Dice](hit-point-dice-xphb.md) you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the total (minimum of 1 Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional [Hit Point Dice](hit-point-dice-xphb.md) after each roll.  
- **Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.  

## Interrupting the Rest

A Short Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md)  
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip  
- Taking any damage  

An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.
