# Ritual
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have a spell prepared that has the Ritual tag, you can cast that spell as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.
