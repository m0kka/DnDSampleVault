# Climbing
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

While you're climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md)). You ignore this extra cost if you have a [Climb Speed](climb-speed-xphb.md) and use it to climb. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](skills.md#Athletics)) check.
