# Shape-Shifting
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the [Polymorph](polymorph-xphb.md) spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies what happens to you. Unless that description says otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—[Condition](condition-xphb.md), spells, curses, and the like—carry over from one form to the other. You revert to your true form if you die.
