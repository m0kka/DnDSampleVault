# D20 Test
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: [Ability Check](ability-check-xphb.md), [Attack Roll](attack-roll-xphb.md), and [Saving Throw](saving-throw-xphb.md). If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The DM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance.
