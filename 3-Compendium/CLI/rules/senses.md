# Senses

## Blindsight
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361_

If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific range without relying on physical sight. Within that range, you can see anything that isn't behind [Cover](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) even if you have the [Blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) condition or are in [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md). Moreover, in that range, you can see something that has the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

## Darkvision
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 365_

If you have Darkvision, you can see in [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) within a specified range as if it were [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) and in [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) within that range as if it were [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md). You discern colors in that [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) only as shades of gray.

## Tremorsense
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377_

A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.

Tremorsense can't detect creatures or objects in the air, and it doesn't count as a form of sight.

## Truesight
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377_

If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:

- **Darkness.** You can see in normal and magical [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).  
- **Invisibility.** You see creatures and objects that have the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition.  
- **Visual Illusions.** Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on [Saving Throw](saving-throw-xphb.md) against them.  
- **Transformations.** You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.  
- **Ethereal Plane.** You see into the Ethereal Plane.
