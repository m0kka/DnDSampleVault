# Diseases

## Cackle Fever
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 61_

Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids only (gnomes are strangely immune). A creature suffers the following effects `1d4` days after infection:

- **Fever.** The creature gains 1 [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) level, which lasts until the contagion ends on the creature.  
- **Uncontrollable Laughter.** While the creature has the [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) condition, the creature makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each time it takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (`1d10`) Psychic damage and has the [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition as it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.  

### Fighting the Contagion

At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.

### Spreading the Contagion

Any Humanoid (other than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot [Emanation [Area of Effect]](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from a creature infected with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.

## Frigid Woe
_Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 125_

Frigid woe is a special disease developed by Aeor's mages that cannot be cured by conventional treatment or magic. The only way a creature infected with the disease can be cured is by finding and drinking the manufactured antidote, a milky liquid stored in gold vials found in Eiselcross's ruins. This disease was created to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the healing power of their clerics and angels.

The disease is transmitted by breathing in blue spores that Aeor's mages created long ago. When a creature comes into contact with these spores, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with frigid woe. It takes `1d4` days for the symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. These symptoms include fatigue, chills, and visible blue veins that appear on the creature's body. The infected creature's speed is reduced by 5 feet as long as it remains infected. Every 10 days after symptoms appear, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced by another 5 feet. If a creature's speed is reduced to 0 as a result of this disease, the creature dies and its body turns into a statue made of ice.

A creature can drink the antidote as an action, ending all symptoms and effects of the disease instantly.

## Sewer Plague
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 61_

Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyughs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a creature that carries the contagion or that comes into contact with contaminated filth or offal must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers the following effects `1d4` days after infection:

- **Fatigue.** The creature gains 1 [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) level.  
- **Weakness.** While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice.  
- **Restlessness.** While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature's Exhaustion level.  

### Fighting the Contagion

Daily at dawn, an infected creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion) level as its fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature's Exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the creature's Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion ends on the creature.

## Sight Rot
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 61_

Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the contagion ends.

### Fighting the Contagion

Magic such as a [Heal](/3-Compendium/CLI/spells/heal-xphb.md) or [Lesser Restoration](lesser-restoration-xphb.md) spell ends the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an [Herbalism Kit](herbalism-kit-xphb.md) can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on the creature.

### Spreading the Contagion

Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.
