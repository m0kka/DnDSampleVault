# Item Properties

## Attunement
_Source: attunement_

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.

A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.

### Optional Attunement

Attunement may be required for this item.

### Requires Attunement

## Attunement
_Source: _

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond—called Attunement—with them before the creature can use an item's magical properties. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren't attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

### Attune during a Short Rest

Attuning to an item requires you to spend a [Short Rest](short-rest-xphb.md) focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same Short Rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, you're attuned to the magic item and can access its full magical capabilities.

### No More Than Three Items

You can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item first. Additionally, you can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, you can't attune to more than one Ring of Protection at a time.

### Ending Attunement

Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another [Short Rest](short-rest-xphb.md) focused on the item unless the item is cursed.

## General and Weapon Properties

### Ammunition
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 213. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

### Ammunition
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 72_

**Ammunition.** Firearm Bullets are destroyed upon use in a modern firearm. Futuristic firearms use Energy Cells that become depleted but could possibly be recharged with the proper equipment, at the GM's discretion.

### Burst Fire
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 72_

**Burst Fire.** As an action, you can expend 10 pieces of a Burst Fire weapon's ammunition to spray shots in a 10-foot [Cube [Area of Effect]](cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) within the weapon's normal range. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take damage. Roll the weapon's damage once, and apply it to each creature that failed the save.

### Finesse
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 213. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

### Heavy
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 213. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Heavy.** You have [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

### Light
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 213. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Light.** When you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a [Shortsword](shortsword-xphb.md) in one hand and a [Dagger](dagger-xphb.md) in the other using the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action and a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) unless that modifier is negative.

### Loading
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 214. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Loading.** You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), or a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### Reach
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 214. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Reach.** A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

### Reload
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 72_

**Reload.** You can make a limited number of shots with a Reload weapon. You must then reload the weapon as an action or a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md).

### Thrown
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 214. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

### Two-Handed
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 214. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Two-Handed.** A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

### Versatile
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 214. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

**Versatile.** A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

## Improvised Weapons

Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

## Improvised Weapons
_Source: _

If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see "[Improvised Weapons](improvised-weapons-xphb.md)" in the "rules glossary". Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.

## Silvered Weapons

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

## Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

### Lance

You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

### Net

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

## Cursed Items
_Source: _

Some magic items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. Most methods of identifying items, including the identify spell, fail to reveal the presence of a curse, although lore might hint at it.

Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the remove curse spell.

## Poison
_Source: _

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.

Poisons come in the following four types.

### Contact

Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

### Ingested

A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid.

### Inhaled

These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

### Injury

Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.
