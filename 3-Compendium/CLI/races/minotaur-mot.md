## Traits

> [!note]
> These traits are also suitable for minotaurs in other D&D worlds where these people have avoided the demonic influence of Baphomet.

### Age

Minotaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans.

### Alignment

Minotaurs who leave the walls of Skophos have the opportunity to be free of its culture and pursue chaotic alignments, while those who remain within the polis and its tyrannical regime tend toward lawful alignments.

### Size

Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have stocky builds. Your size is Medium.

### Horns

Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to `1d6` + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

### Goring Rush

Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.

### Hammering Horns

Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you.

### Imposing Presence

You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Intimidation or Persuasion.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.

## Description

The minotaurs who dwell in the badlands of Phoberos and the remote polis of Skophos are caught between two worlds. Some follow the dark god Mogis, who has tyrannized them for ages untold and shown them a trail of slaughter that is all many minotaurs have ever known. Others, though, have emerged from this bloody path and found a world that welcomes those who pursue their own destinies and heroic callings.

### Built to Survive

Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. Theros minotaurs often carve their horns to sharpen their edges, etch symbols of power into them, or sheathe them in bronze to prevent them from shattering during battle.

Thick hair extends down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and some have long patches of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves, and they have long, tufted tails. Minotaur priests often adorn themselves with sacred items, be they trophies from fallen foes, keepsakes from their homeland, or naturally occurring marks of their god's favor.

### Ages of Darkness

Although minotaurs aren't evil by nature and are free to worship any god, many are raised among those devoted to Mogis's vile whims. Myths tell that Mogis created the first minotaurs from his own followers, typically criminals and monsters of unspeakable depravity. While many groups of minotaurs still honor their villainous progenitors, others have abandoned their ancestors and moved beyond their crimes, seeking their fates in the future, not the past.

While the inhabitants of Akros and other reaches near Phoberos, the homeland of most minotaur herds, have engaged in endless conflicts with bloodthirsty minotaurs, they know there are those who forsake Mogis's depravities. The people of Meletis, Setessa, and lands beyond are also generally open-minded and curious about minotaurs who wander into their lands. Epics like *The* *Callapheia* also describe multiple heroic minotaurs. As a result, a minotaur traveling in the company of other non-minotaurs is likely to be accepted in any polis.

See "chapter 3" for more details on Phoberos, the minotaur polis of Skophos, and various minotaur bands.

### Passion and Zeal

Minotaurs are known for venting their outrage through violence, but they aren't generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes. This zeal also extends to their faith. Those who have avoided the corrupting influence of Mogis gravitate toward the service of gods who share their bold nature, especially Erebos, Keranos, and Purphoros. Those who have rejected Mogis sometimes embrace his hated twin brother, Iroas.

### Minotaur Names

In the labyrinthine polis of Skophos, the deeds of minotaur champions are carved among the winding halls. Minotaurs often name their children after these great heroes, believing that a child will inherit the strength, audacity, guile, or fearsomeness of a heroic namesake. Other minotaur parents invent their own names, though, believing in their child's potential to light a new constellation in Nyx with the brightness of their own soul.

The Minotaur Namesake table suggests possible qualities or deeds that a minotaur's namesake might have been known for. Your character might strive to emulate that quality or seek to forge a new legacy to be associated with your name by future generations.

- **Female Names.** Bozzri, Dhazdoro, Erinimachis, Ghalantzo, Halafoti, Kerania, MitÃ©vra, Philoprodis, Tavromiki, Ypoudoris

> [!readaloud] Myth of Mogis and the Minotaurs
> 
> 
> Some legends claim that Mogis created the minotaurs, transforming his most bloodthirsty followers so that their hulking bodies resembled his own. However, while the tales told in the labyrinth-polis of Skophos affirm that Mogis rewarded his most devoted followers, they assert that these followers were already minotaurs, and all Mogis did was exalt them to an honored status. Among minotaurs who worship Mogis, these heroes are revered as spiritual if not literal ancestors. The moral of this story is simply that Mogis is a god who rewards his faithful servants.
> 
> Minotaurs who don't follow Mogis are quick to point out that this myth says nothing about the nature of minotaurs. The worship of Mogis, they argue, is no more inherent to them than it is to humans, and minotaurs aren't destined to a life of slaughter because of the circumstances of their creation. Perhaps most importantly, minotaurs aren't an offshoot of humanity but a people in their own right, and neither their nature nor their destiny is tied to a single god.
