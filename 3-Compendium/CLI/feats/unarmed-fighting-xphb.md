# Unarmed Fighting
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 210*  

When you hit with your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to `1d6` plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike. If you aren't holding any weapons or a Shield when you make the attack roll, the `d6` becomes a `d8`.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal `1d4` Bludgeoning damage to one creature [Grappled](conditions.md#Grappled) by you.
