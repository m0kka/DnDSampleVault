# Poisoner
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 206*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You gain the following benefits.

## Potent Poison

When you make a damage roll that deals Poison damage, it ignores Resistance to Poison damage.

## Brew Poison

You gain proficiency with the Poisoner's Kit. With 1 hour of work using such a kit and expending 50 GP worth of materials, you can create a number of poison doses equal to your Proficiency Bonus. As a Bonus Action, you can apply a poison dose to a weapon or piece of ammunition. Once applied, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you deal damage with the [poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) item, whichever is shorter. When a creature takes damage from the [poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) item, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the modifier of the ability increased by this feat and your Proficiency Bonus) or take `2d8` Poison damage and have the [Poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the end of your next turn.
