# Blessed Warrior
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 110*  

**Prerequisite**: When Gaining the Level 2 Paladin "Fighting Style" Feature

You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice. [Guidance](guidance-xphb.md) and [Sacred Flame](sacred-flame-xphb.md) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.
