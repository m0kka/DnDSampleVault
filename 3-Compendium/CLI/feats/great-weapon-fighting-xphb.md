# Great Weapon Fighting
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 209. Available in the Free Rules (2024)*  

When you roll damage for an attack you make with a Melee weapon that you are holding with two hands, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property to gain this benefit.
