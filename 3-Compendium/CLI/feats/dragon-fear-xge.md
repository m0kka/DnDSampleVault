# Dragon Fear
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

**Prerequisite**: [Dragonborn](dragonborn-xphb.md)

When angered, you radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:

- Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
