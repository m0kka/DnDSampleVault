# Interception
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 209*  

When a creature you can see hits another creature within 5 feet of you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage dealt to the target by `1d10` plus your Proficiency Bonus. You must be holding a Shield or a Simple or Martial weapon to use this Reaction.
