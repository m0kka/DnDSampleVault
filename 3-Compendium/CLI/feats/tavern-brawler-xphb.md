# Tavern Brawler
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 202*  

You gain the following benefits.

## Enhanced Unarmed Strike

When you hit with your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to `1d4` plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.

## Damage Rerolls

Whenever you roll a damage die for your Unarmed Strike, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.

## Improvised Weaponry

You have proficiency with improvised weapons.

## Push

When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike as part of the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can deal damage to the target and also push it 5 feet away from you. You can use this benefit only once per turn.
