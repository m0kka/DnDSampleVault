# Actor
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 202*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level; Charisma 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

## Impersonation

While you're disguised as a real or fictional person, you have Advantage on Charisma ([Deception](skills.md#Deception) or [Performance](skills.md#Performance)) checks to convince others that you are that person.

## Mimicry

You can mimic the sounds of other creatures, including speech. A creature that hears the mimicry must succeed on a Wisdom ([Insight](skills.md#Insight)) check to determine the effect is faked (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
