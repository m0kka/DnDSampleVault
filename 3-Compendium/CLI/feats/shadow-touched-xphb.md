# Shadow-Touched
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 207*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

Your exposure to the Shadowfell's magic grants you the following benefits.

## Shadow Magic

Choose one level 1 spell from the Illusion or Necromancy school of magic. You always have that spell and the [Invisibility](invisibility-xphb.md) spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
