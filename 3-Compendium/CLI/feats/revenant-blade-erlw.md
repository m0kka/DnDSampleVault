# Revenant Blade
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 22*  

**Prerequisite**: [Elf](elf-xphb.md)

You are descended from a master of the [double-bladed scimitar](double-bladed-scimitar-erlw.md), and some of that mastery has passed on to you. You gain the following benefits:

- While you are holding a double-bladed scimitar with two hands, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.  
- A double-bladed scimitar has the finesse property when you wield it.
