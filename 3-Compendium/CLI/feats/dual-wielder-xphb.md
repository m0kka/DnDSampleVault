# Dual Wielder
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 203*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level; Strength 13 or higher or 4th-level; Dexterity 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

## Enhanced Dual Wielding

When you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action on your turn and attack with a weapon that has the Light property, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn with a different weapon, which must be a Melee weapon that lacks the Two-Handed property. You don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative.

## Quick Draw

You can draw or stow two weapons that lack the Two-Handed property when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
