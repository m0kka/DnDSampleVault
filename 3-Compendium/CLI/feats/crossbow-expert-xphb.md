# Crossbow Expert
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 203*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level; Dexterity 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

## Ignore Loading

You ignore the Loading property of the Hand Crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, and Light Crossbow (all called crossbows elsewhere in this feat). If you're holding one of them, you can load a piece of ammunition into it even if you lack a free hand.

## Firing in Melee

Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls with crossbows.

## Dual Wielding

When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the extra attack if that attack is with a crossbow that has the Light property and you aren't already adding that modifier to the damage.
