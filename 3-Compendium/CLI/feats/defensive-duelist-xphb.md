**Prerequisite**: 4th-level; Dexterity 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

## Parry

If you're holding a Finesse weapon and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can take a Reaction to add your Proficiency Bonus to your Armor Class, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You gain this bonus to your AC against melee attacks until the start of your next turn.
