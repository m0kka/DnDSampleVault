# Two-Weapon Fighting
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 210. Available in the Free Rules (2024)*  

When you make an extra attack as a result of using a weapon that has the Light property, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of that attack if you aren't already adding it to the damage.
