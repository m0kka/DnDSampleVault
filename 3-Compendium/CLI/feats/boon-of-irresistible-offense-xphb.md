# Boon of Irresistible Offense
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 211*  

**Prerequisite**: 19th-level

You gain the following benefits.

## Overcome Defenses

The Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage you deal always ignores Resistance.

## Overwhelming Strike

When you roll a 20 on the `d20` for an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to the ability score increased by this feat. The extra damage's type is the same as the attack's type.
