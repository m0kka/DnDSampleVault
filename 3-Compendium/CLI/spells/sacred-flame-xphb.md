# Sacred Flame
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `1d8` Radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from Half [Cover](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) or Three-Quarters [Cover](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) for this save.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).
