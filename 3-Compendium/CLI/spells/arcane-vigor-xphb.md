# Arcane Vigor
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You tap into your life force to heal yourself. Roll one or two of your unexpended [Hit Point Dice](hit-point-dice-xphb.md), and regain a number of [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the roll's total plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Those dice are then expended.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The number of unexpended Hit Dice you can roll increases by one for each spell slot level above 2.
