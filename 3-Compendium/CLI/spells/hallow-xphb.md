You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy or unholy power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect of Hallow. The affected area has the following effects.

## Hallowed Ward

Choose any of these creature types: Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead. Creatures of the chosen types can't willingly enter the area, and any creature that is possessed by or that has the [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) or [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition from such creatures isn't possessed, [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed), or [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) by them while in the area.

You bind an extra effect to the area from the list below:

- **Courage.** Creatures of any types you choose can't gain the [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition while in the area.  
- **Darkness.** [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a level lower than this spell, can't illuminate the area.  
- **Daylight.** Bright light fills the area. Magical [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) created by spells of a level lower than this spell can't extinguish the light.
