# Mending
*cantrip, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, two lodestones
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.
