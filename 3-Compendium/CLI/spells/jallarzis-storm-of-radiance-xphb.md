# Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance
*5th-level, Evocation*  
![](spells/XPHB/Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a pinch of phosphorus
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. While in this area, creatures have the [Blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) and [Deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) conditions, and they can't cast spells with a Verbal component.

When the storm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `2d10` Radiant damage and `2d10` Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 5.
