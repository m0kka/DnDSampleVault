# Ice Storm
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a mitten
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the Cylinder makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `2d10` Bludgeoning damage and `4d6` Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the Cylinder into [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md) until the end of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Bludgeoning damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 4.
