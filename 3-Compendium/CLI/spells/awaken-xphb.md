# Awaken
*5th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 8 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, an agate worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the [Awakened Shrub](awakened-shrub-xmm.md) or [Awakened Tree](awakened-tree-xmm.md) in the "Monster Manual".

The awakened target has the [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.
