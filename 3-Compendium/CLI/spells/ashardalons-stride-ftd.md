# Ashardalon's Stride
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  
![Fire follows in the footst...](spells/FTD/Ashardalon's Stride.webp#right "Fire follows in the footsteps of a red dragon who has cast Ashardalon's stride.")  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The billowing flames of a dragon blast from your feet, granting you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 20 feet and moving doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, it takes `1d6` fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase your speed by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 3rd. The spell deals an additional `1d6` fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.
