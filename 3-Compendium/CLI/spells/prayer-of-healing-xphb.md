# Prayer of Healing
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to five creatures of your choice who remain within range for the spell's entire casting gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](short-rest-xphb.md) and also regain `2d8` [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). A creature can't be affected by this spell again until that creature finishes a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 2.
