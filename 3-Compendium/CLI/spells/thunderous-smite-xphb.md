Your strike rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the target takes an extra `2d6` Thunder damage from the attack. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and have the [Prone](conditions.md#Prone) condition.
