# Summon Undead
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  
![](spells/XPHB/Summon Undead.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a gilded skull worth 300+ GP
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth an Undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [Undead Spirit](undead-spirit-xphb.md) stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature's form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The spirit resembles an Undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
