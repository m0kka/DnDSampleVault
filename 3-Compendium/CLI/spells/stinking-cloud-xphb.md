# Stinking Cloud
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a rotten egg
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is [Heavily Obscured](heavily-obscured-xphb.md). The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by [Gust of Wind](gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the end of the current turn. While [Poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, the creature can't take an action or a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md).
