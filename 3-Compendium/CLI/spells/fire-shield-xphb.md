# Fire Shield
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a bit of phosphorus or a firefly
- **Duration:** 10 minute

Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 10 feet.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you [Resistance](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you [Resistance](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes `2d8` Fire damage from a warm shield or `2d8` Cold damage from a chill shield.
