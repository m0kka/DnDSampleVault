# Power Word Stun
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) or fewer, it has the [Stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) condition. Otherwise, its [Speed](speed-xphb.md) is 0 until the start of your next turn.

The [Stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.
