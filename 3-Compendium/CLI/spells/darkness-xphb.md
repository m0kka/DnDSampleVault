# Darkness
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, bat fur and a piece of coal
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

For the duration, magical [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the [Darkness](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) or [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
