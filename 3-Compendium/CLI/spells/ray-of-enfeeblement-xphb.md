# Ray of Enfeeblement
*2nd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of enervating energy shoots from you toward a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the target has [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on Strength-based [D20 Test](d20-test-xphb.md) for the duration. During that time, it also subtracts `1d8` from all its damage rolls. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
