# Light
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, a firefly or phosphorescent moss
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one Large or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.
