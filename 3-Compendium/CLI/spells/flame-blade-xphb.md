# Flame Blade
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a sumac leaf
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md).

As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to `3d6` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

The flaming blade sheds [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 10 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 2.
