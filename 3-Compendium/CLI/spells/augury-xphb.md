- **Components:** V, S, specially marked sticks, bones, cards, or other divinatory tokens worth 25+ GP
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses the omen from the Omens table.

**Omens**

| Weal | Good |
| Woe | Bad |

^omens

The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md), there is a cumulative  chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
