# Blade Barrier
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You create a wall of whirling blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides Three-Quarters [Cover](3-Compendium/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md), and its space is [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md).

Any creature in the wall's space makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `6d10` Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes that save if it enters the wall's space or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.
