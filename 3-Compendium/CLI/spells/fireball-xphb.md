# Fireball
*3rd-level, Evocation*  
![](spells/XPHB/Fireball.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a ball of bat guano and sulfur
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from you to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into a fiery explosion. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `8d6` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start [burning](burning-xphb.md).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 3.
