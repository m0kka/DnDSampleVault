# Cloud of Daggers
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a sliver of glass
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot Cube centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes `4d4` Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the Cube or ends its turn there or if the Cube moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

On your later turns, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to teleport the Cube up to 30 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `2d4` for each spell slot level above 2.
