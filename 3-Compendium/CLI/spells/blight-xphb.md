# Blight
*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `8d8` Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.

Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn't make a save; it simply withers and dies.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 4.
