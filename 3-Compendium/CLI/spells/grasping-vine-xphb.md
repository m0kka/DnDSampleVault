# Grasping Vine
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration.

Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes `4d8` Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the [Grappled](conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a [Grappled](conditions.md#Grappled) creature (no action required).

As a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The number of creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above 4.
