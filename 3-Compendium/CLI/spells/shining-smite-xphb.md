# Shining Smite
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The target hit by the strike takes an extra `2d6` Radiant damage from the attack. Until the spell ends, the target sheds [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 5-foot radius, attack rolls against it have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md), and it can't benefit from the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 2.
