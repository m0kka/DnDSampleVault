# Entangle
*1st-level, Conjuration*  
![](spells/XPHB/Entangle.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md). They disappear when the spell ends.

Each creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [Restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) condition until the spell ends. A [Restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) creature can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](skills.md#Athletics)) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer [Restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) by them.
