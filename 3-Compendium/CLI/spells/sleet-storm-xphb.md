# Sleet Storm
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a miniature umbrella
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius Cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. The area is [Heavily Obscured](heavily-obscured-xphb.md), and exposed flames in the area are doused.

Ground in the Cylinder is [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md). When a creature enters the Cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](conditions.md#Prone) condition and lose [Concentration](conditions.md#Concentration).
