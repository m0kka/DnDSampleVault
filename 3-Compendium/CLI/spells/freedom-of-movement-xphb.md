# Freedom of Movement
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a leather strap
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md), and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's [Speed](speed-xphb.md) nor cause the target to have the [Paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [Restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) conditions. The target also has a [Swim Speed](swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to its [Speed](speed-xphb.md).

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [Grappled](conditions.md#Grappled) condition on it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
