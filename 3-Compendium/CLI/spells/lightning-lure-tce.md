# Lightning Lure
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action

- **Components:** V

You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you and then take `1d8` lightning damage if it is within 5 feet of you.

This spell's damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).
