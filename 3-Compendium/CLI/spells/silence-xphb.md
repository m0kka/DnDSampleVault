# Silence
*2nd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the Sphere has [Immunity](immunity-xphb.md) to Thunder damage, and creatures have the [Deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) condition while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a Verbal component is impossible there.
