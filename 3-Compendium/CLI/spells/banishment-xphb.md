# Banishment
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a pentacle
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice) associated with its creature type.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
